Chapter IX of the book "Sociologistic School" discusses the formal school and its systematics of social relationship. The formal school is a sociological theory that emphasizes the importance of social structure in understanding human behavior. The theory argues that social structure is the foundation of society and that it shapes the way people interact with each other. The formal school is based on the work of Émile Durkheim, who argued that society is a system of interrelated parts that work together to maintain order. Durkheim believed that social structure is created through social interaction and that it is constantly changing. The formal school has been criticized for being too deterministic and for ignoring the role of human agency in shaping society. However, the theory has also been praised for its insights into the importance of social structure in understanding human behavior.

## Key Concepts and Figures

The key concepts of the formal school include social structure, social interaction, and social change. The formal school is associated with a number of figures, including Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Robert Merton.

## Contributions and Implications

The formal school has made a number of important contributions to sociology. These include:

* **Highlighting the importance of social structure.** The formal school has shown that social structure is a powerful force that shapes human behavior. This insight has helped sociologists to understand how society works and how it can be changed.
* **Developing a systematic approach to studying social structure.** The formal school has developed a number of tools and concepts for studying social structure. These tools have helped sociologists to understand the complex relationships between different parts of society.
* **Providing a framework for understanding social change.** The formal school has shown that social change is a natural and inevitable part of society. This insight has helped sociologists to understand how societies can adapt to change and how they can be transformed.

## Significance and Impact

The formal school has had a significant impact on sociology. The theory has been used to study a wide range of social phenomena, including crime, poverty, and inequality. The formal school has also influenced other sociological theories, such as the conflict school and the symbolic interactionist school.

## Conclusion

The formal school is a valuable sociological theory that has made a number of important contributions to the field. The theory's emphasis on social structure has helped sociologists to understand how society works and how it can be changed. The formal school's systematic approach to studying social structure has also provided sociologists with a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationships between different parts of society. The formal school's insights into social change have helped sociologists to understand how societies can adapt to change and how they can be transformed.

## Metaphor

The formal school can be compared to a building. The building's structure is the foundation on which it rests. The building's structure determines how the building is used and how it functions. The building's structure can be changed, but it is a slow and difficult process. The formal school is similar to a building in that it provides a framework for understanding society. The formal school's framework is based on the concept of social structure. Social structure is the foundation on which society rests. Social structure determines how society is organized and how it functions. Social structure can be changed, but it is a slow and difficult process. The formal school provides a valuable tool for understanding society and for understanding how it can be changed.

## Leading Representatives

Formal sociologistic school, while adhering to sociologistic principles, posits that sociology's unique area is the study of social interaction forms. It aims to establish sociology as a defined, systematic science. Founders are Friedrich Tonnies and Georg Simmel, with many other key representatives.

Georg Simmel (1858-1918) was a pivotal figure in formal sociology. He argued that to be truly distinct, sociology needs its own field of study, not investigated by other social sciences. Simmel saw this unique field in the study of socialization forms or human relationships. He believed that social forms, akin to geometric forms, could have different contents, thus different forms of human relationships might contain different social content. This perspective justified sociology as a distinct science aimed at describing, classifying, analyzing, and explaining the forms of human relationships rather than their content, which are studied by other sciences. Simmel's notion of sociology as a specific social science significantly influenced its development.

Simmel's work has been influential in the development of sociology, and he is considered to be one of the most important sociologists of the 19th century. His work has been used to study a wide range of social phenomena, including urban life, social conflict, and social change.

Simmel's most important works include:

* "The Sociology of Sociability" (1908)
* "The Philosophy of Money" (1900)
* "The Stranger" (1908)
* "Conflict" (1910)
* "Fashion" (1904)

Simmel's work has been praised for its originality and insight, and it has had a significant impact on the development of sociology. However, his work has also been criticized for being too abstract and for not providing enough empirical evidence to support his claims.

Despite these criticisms, Simmel's work remains an important contribution to the field of sociology. His insights into social forms have helped to shape the way that sociologists think about the social world, and his work continues to be studied and debated by sociologists today.

## Formal Sociology

The formal school of sociology focuses on the relationship between community and society. The main contributors to the school are Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel, Richard Stammler, and Leopold von Wiese.

### Community and Society

Tönnies (1855-1936) was a German sociologist who developed a theory of community and society. He argued that community is based on personal relationships and shared values, while society is based on impersonal relationships and formal institutions. Tönnies' work has been influential in the development of sociological theory, and his concepts of community and society have been used to understand a wide range of social phenomena.

### Georg Simmel

Simmel (1858-1918) was a German sociologist who was interested in the forms of social interaction. He argued that social interaction is not simply the sum of individual actions, but that it has its own unique properties. Simmel's work has been influential in the development of microsociology, and his concepts of social interaction have been used to understand a wide range of social phenomena.

### Richard Stammler

Stammler (1856-1920) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was interested in the relationship between law and society. He argued that law is not simply a set of rules, but that it is also a reflection of the social values of a society. Stammler's work has been influential in the development of legal sociology, and his concepts of law and society have been used to understand a wide range of legal phenomena.

### Leopold von Wiese

Wiese (1876-1969) was a German sociologist who was interested in the development of a systematic sociology. He argued that sociology should be based on a rigorous methodology, and that it should be able to explain a wide range of social phenomena. Wiese's work has been influential in the development of sociological theory, and his concepts of social structure and social process have been used to understand a wide range of social phenomena.

### Conclusion

The formal school of sociology has made a significant contribution to the development of sociological theory. The work of Tönnies, Simmel, Stammler, and Wiese has helped to clarify the relationship between community and society, social interaction, law and society, and the development of a systematic sociology. These scholars have laid the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of the social world.

**Metaphor:**

The formal school of sociology can be compared to a microscope. Just as a microscope allows us to see things that are too small to be seen with the naked eye, the formal school of sociology allows us to see the underlying structures and processes of society. This understanding of society can help us to make sense of the world around us and to develop more effective ways of solving social problems.

## Summary

The text discusses the sociological theory of **modernity**. It argues that modernity is a form of social organization that is characterized by impersonal relationships and contractual obligations. This is in contrast to traditional societies, which are characterized by personal relationships and communal obligations.

The text identifies several key features of modernity. These include:

* **Industrialization:** The shift from a predominantly agricultural economy to a predominantly industrial economy.
* **Urbanization:** The growth of cities and the decline of rural areas.
* **The rise of the nation-state:** The emergence of centralized governments that exercise control over large territories.
* **The growth of bureaucracy:** The proliferation of complex organizations that are governed by rules and regulations.
* **The spread of mass media:** The increased availability of information and communication technologies.

The text argues that these features of modernity have profound implications for social life. They lead to the breakdown of traditional social ties and the emergence of new forms of social organization. This can be seen in the rise of individualism, the decline of community, and the increasing importance of social institutions.

The text concludes by arguing that modernity is a complex and contradictory phenomenon. It has both positive and negative aspects. It can lead to greater freedom and opportunity, but it can also lead to alienation and social inequality.

## Key Concepts and Figures

* **Modernity:** A form of social organization that is characterized by impersonal relationships and contractual obligations.
* **Industrialization:** The shift from a predominantly agricultural economy to a predominantly industrial economy.
* **Urbanization:** The growth of cities and the decline of rural areas.
* **The rise of the nation-state:** The emergence of centralized governments that exercise control over large territories.
* **The growth of bureaucracy:** The proliferation of complex organizations that are governed by rules and regulations.
* **The spread of mass media:** The increased availability of information and communication technologies.

## Key Contributors

* **Max Weber:** German sociologist who developed a theory of modernity that emphasizes the role of rationalization.
* **Émile Durkheim:** French sociologist who developed a theory of modernity that emphasizes the role of social solidarity.
* **Karl Marx:** German philosopher and economist who developed a theory of modernity that emphasizes the role of class conflict.
* **Sigmund Freud:** Austrian neurologist and psychologist who developed a theory of modernity that emphasizes the role of the unconscious mind.

## Implications of Modernity

* The breakdown of traditional social ties and the emergence of new forms of social organization.
* The rise of individualism, the decline of community, and the increasing importance of social institutions.
* The growth of social inequality and the emergence of new forms of social conflict.
* The increasing importance of science and technology in society.
* The increasing interconnectedness of the world and the emergence of a globalized society.

## Significance and Impact

The theory of modernity has had a profound impact on sociology and social thought. It has been used to explain a wide range of social phenomena, from the rise of capitalism to the decline of religion. It has also been used to criticize modernity and to argue for the need for a return to traditional values.

## Metaphor

Modernity can be compared to a machine. It is a complex and impersonal system that is governed by rules and regulations. It can be efficient and productive, but it can also be alienating and dehumanizing.## Summary

This text discusses the difference between society and community. Society is a large and impersonal group of people who share a common culture and institutions. Community, on the other hand, is a smaller and more intimate group of people who share personal relationships and values.

## Key Concepts and Figures

* Society: A large and impersonal group of people who share a common culture and institutions.
* Community: A smaller and more intimate group of people who share personal relationships and values.
* Emile Durkheim: A French sociologist who argued that society is a product of social interaction.
* Ferdinand Tönnies: A German sociologist who argued that society is divided into two types: Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society).
* Robert Putnam: An American political scientist who argued that social capital is essential for a healthy community.

## Contributions and Implications

Durkheim's work on society has had a profound impact on sociology. His theory of social facts has been used to explain a wide range of social phenomena, from crime and deviance to religion and education. Tönnies' distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft has also been influential, and his work has been used to understand the changing nature of society in the modern world. Putnam's research on social capital has shown the importance of community ties for individual well-being and for the functioning of society as a whole.

## Significance and Impact

The study of society and community is important because it helps us to understand the social world around us. By understanding the different types of social groups and the forces that shape them, we can better understand our own place in society and how we can contribute to making it a better place.

## Metaphor

Society can be compared to a large machine, while community can be compared to a small village. In a machine, the parts are all connected and work together to achieve a common goal. In a village, the people are all connected by personal relationships and shared values. Both society and community are essential for human flourishing, but they play different roles in our lives.## The Formal School of Sociology

The formal school of sociology argues that society is becoming increasingly impersonal and contractual, while community is becoming increasingly rare. This is because, as societies become more complex, people interact with each other less and less in person and more and more through institutions and organizations. As a result, social relationships become more formal and less personal.

## Von Wiese's Classification of Social Relationships

Von Wiese's book is an attempt to give a systematic classification of the forms of human relationship. He divides relationships into two orders: interindividual and intergroup. Interindividual relations are classed into three principal forms: toward each other, away from each other, and mixed form. Intergroup relations are classified into four principal divisions: differentiating, integrating, destructive, and modifying-constructive processes. Each of the mentioned subdivisions is subdivided into many sub-subclasses which, in their totality, give about 650 forms of human relationship.

## Criticisms of the Formal School of Sociology

The formal school of sociology has been criticized for being too abstract and for not taking into account the historical and cultural context of social relationships. It has also been criticized for being too focused on the negative aspects of social relationships and for not giving enough attention to the positive aspects.

## Conclusion

The formal school of sociology is not new and its claim that it is the only one that studies forms of social relationships is false. However, it does provide a useful framework for understanding the different types of social relationships that exist.

## Metaphor

The formal school of sociology can be compared to a map of the world. Just as a map can help us to understand the different countries and regions of the world, so the formal school of sociology can help us to understand the different types of social relationships that exist.## Introduction

Sociology is the study of society and social relationships. It is a social science that uses a variety of methods to examine how people interact with each other, how societies are organized, and how social change occurs.

## Key Concepts

Some of the key concepts in sociology include:

* **Social structure:** The system of social relationships that organizes a society.
* **Social institutions:** The major social organizations in a society, such as the family, the economy, and the government.
* **Social interaction:** The process by which people communicate and interact with each other.
* **Social change:** The process by which societies change over time.

## Key Figures

Some of the key figures in the history of sociology include:

* **Émile Durkheim:** Durkheim was a French sociologist who is considered one of the founders of the discipline. He is best known for his work on social solidarity and social facts.
* **Max Weber:** Weber was a German sociologist who is considered one of the most influential sociologists of all time. He is best known for his work on bureaucracy, rationalization, and social stratification.
* **Karl Marx:** Marx was a German philosopher, economist, and sociologist who is considered one of the most important thinkers in history. He is best known for his work on capitalism, class struggle, and alienation.

## Contributions and Implications

The work of these and other sociologists has had a profound impact on our understanding of society and social relationships. Their insights have helped us to understand how societies are organized, how social change occurs, and how people interact with each other.

## Significance and Impact

Sociology is a valuable tool for understanding the world around us. It can help us to understand the causes of social problems, develop solutions to those problems, and create a more just and equitable society.

## Conclusion

Sociology is a complex and challenging field, but it is also a fascinating and rewarding one. It offers us a unique perspective on the world around us and helps us to understand the human condition in a deeper way.

**Metaphor:** Sociology is like a microscope that allows us to see the invisible forces that shape our society.## The Distinction Between Form and Content of Social Relationships

In his book **The Structure of Social Action**, Talcott Parsons argues that the distinction between form and content of social relationships is either fallacious or cannot be used to build sociology as a separate science.

### The Fallacy of the Form-Content Distinction

Parsons begins by arguing that the form-content distinction is fallacious because it is based on the assumption that social relationships can be separated into two distinct parts: the form, which is the abstract structure of the relationship, and the content, which is the specific content of the relationship. However, Parsons argues that this distinction is not tenable because the form and content of social relationships are inextricably intertwined. For example, the form of a relationship between two friends is different from the form of a relationship between two enemies, and the content of a relationship between two parents and their child is different from the content of a relationship between two coworkers.

### The Inability of the Form-Content Distinction to Build Sociology as a Separate Science

Parsons also argues that the form-content distinction cannot be used to build sociology as a separate science because it is based on the assumption that sociology is the study of social relationships, while other social sciences, such as economics and political science, are the study of the content of social relationships. However, Parsons argues that this distinction is not tenable because all social sciences are concerned with the study of social relationships, and the distinction between sociology and other social sciences is based on the different methods that are used to study social relationships.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Parsons argues that the distinction between form and content of social relationships is either fallacious or cannot be used to build sociology as a separate science. He argues that this distinction is based on the mistaken assumption that social relationships can be separated into two distinct parts, and that this distinction prevents sociology from developing its own unique methods of studying social relationships.

**Metaphor:**

The distinction between form and content of social relationships is like the distinction between the shape of a tree and the leaves on the tree. The shape of the tree is determined by its genetic code, while the leaves on the tree are determined by the environment in which the tree grows. Similarly, the form of a social relationship is determined by its social structure, while the content of a social relationship is determined by the specific individuals who are involved in the relationship.## The School of Formal Sociology

The school of formal sociology is a sociological theory that emphasizes the importance of social forms over social content. This school of thought argues that the structure of social relationships is more important than the specific content of those relationships.

### Key Concepts

* **Social forms:** The basic building blocks of society, such as roles, statuses, and groups.
* **Social content:** The specific content of social relationships, such as the beliefs, values, and norms that people share.
* **Formal sociology:** The study of social forms and their impact on society.

### Key Figures

* Georg Simmel: One of the most influential proponents of formal sociology. Simmel argued that social forms are independent of social content and that they can be studied in their own right.
* Vilfredo Pareto: Another important proponent of formal sociology. Pareto argued that social systems are governed by a small number of fundamental laws.
* Talcott Parsons: A sociologist who attempted to synthesize the insights of the formal school with the more traditional sociological approach.

### Contributions and Implications

The school of formal sociology has made a number of important contributions to sociology. These include:

* The development of a more rigorous and systematic approach to the study of social relationships.
* The identification of a number of fundamental social forms that are common to all societies.
* The development of a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between social structure and social behavior.

However, the school of formal sociology has also been criticized for a number of reasons. These include:

* The focus on social forms over social content can lead to a neglect of the real-world problems that people face.
* The emphasis on abstract laws can lead to a lack of understanding of the specific context in which social relationships operate.
* The school of formal sociology has been accused of being too theoretical and not providing enough practical guidance.

### Conclusion

The school of formal sociology is a valuable contribution to sociological thought. However, it is important to be aware of its strengths and weaknesses when using it to understand the social world.

## A Metaphor for Formal Sociology

Formal sociology can be compared to a blueprint for a house. The blueprint does not tell you what kind of furniture to put in the house or how to decorate it. It simply provides the basic structure that the house will be built on. In the same way, formal sociology provides the basic structure for understanding social relationships. It does not tell you what specific beliefs, values, or norms people will have in a particular society. It simply provides the framework for understanding how those beliefs, values, and norms will interact with each other to create a particular social system.# The Philosophy of Georg Simmel

## Introduction

Georg Simmel (1858-1918) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and cultural critic. He is considered one of the founders of sociology, and his work has had a significant impact on the development of the field.

Simmel's philosophy is often described as a form of "formal sociology," which focuses on the study of social forms and their relationship to human experience. Simmel was interested in the ways in which social structures and institutions shape our understanding of the world, and how our own actions and interactions contribute to the creation of these structures.

## Key Concepts

Some of the key concepts in Simmel's philosophy include:

* **Form and content:** Simmel argues that all social phenomena can be understood in terms of their form and content. The form of a social phenomenon refers to its underlying structure or organization, while the content refers to the specific content or values that are expressed through this structure.
* **Individuality and society:** Simmel argues that the individual and society are in a constant state of tension. On the one hand, the individual is shaped by society and its norms and values. On the other hand, the individual also has the potential to challenge and change society.
* **The metropolis:** Simmel argues that the metropolis is a unique social environment that has a profound impact on its inhabitants. The metropolis is characterized by its diversity, anonymity, and rapid pace of life. These factors can lead to feelings of alienation and anomie, but they can also foster creativity and innovation.

## Figures

In addition to Simmel himself, some of the key figures in the development of his philosophy include:

* Ferdinand Tönnies: Tönnies was a German sociologist who was a close friend and colleague of Simmel. Tönnies' work on Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (community and society) was a major influence on Simmel's thinking.
* Max Weber: Weber was a German sociologist and economist who was also a close friend and colleague of Simmel. Weber's work on bureaucracy, rationalization, and social stratification was also a major influence on Simmel's thinking.
* Émile Durkheim: Durkheim was a French sociologist who was a major influence on Simmel's thinking. Durkheim's work on social facts, collective consciousness, and ritual was also a major influence on Simmel's thinking.

## Contributions and Implications

Simmel's philosophy has had a significant impact on the development of sociology and social theory. His work has been used to understand a wide range of social phenomena, including urban life, social inequality, and the relationship between the individual and society. Simmel's work has also been influential in other fields, such as philosophy, psychology, and cultural studies.

## Significance and Impact

Simmel's philosophy is significant for a number of reasons. First, it provides a unique and insightful perspective on the relationship between the individual and society. Second, it offers a powerful analysis of the social forces that shape our lives. Third, it is a valuable contribution to the development of social theory.

## Conclusion

Simmel's philosophy is a complex and challenging body of work, but it is also a rewarding one. His insights into the nature of social life are both profound and thought-provoking. Simmel's work continues to be relevant today, and it is likely to continue to be influential for many years to come.

## Metaphor

Simmel's philosophy can be compared to a kaleidoscope. Just as a kaleidoscope can create a variety of beautiful and complex patterns from a few simple pieces of glass, so too can Simmel's philosophy create a rich and nuanced understanding of social life from a few simple concepts.## Simmel's Sociology of Forms

In his book *Sociology: Study of Forms*, Georg Simmel argues that sociology should study the **forms** of social phenomena, rather than their content. He defines a **form** as "the way in which the elements of a phenomenon are related to each other." For example, the form of a friendship is the way in which two people interact with each other, while the content of a friendship is the specific things that they talk about or do together.

Simmel argues that the forms of social phenomena are more important than their content because they are more general and more enduring. The content of a friendship may change over time, but the form of friendship will remain the same. This is because the form of a friendship is determined by the underlying social structure, which is more stable than the individual interactions that take place within it.

Simmel's sociology of forms has been influential in the development of sociological theory. It has been used to study a wide range of social phenomena, including conflict, cooperation, and social change. Simmel's work has also been influential in the development of social psychology, as it has helped to explain how the structure of social relationships shapes our thoughts and feelings.

## Two Interpretations of Simmel's Claim

Simmel's claim that sociology studies the forms of social phenomena can be interpreted in two ways. First, it can mean that sociology studies the **most general characteristics** of social phenomena which belong to all specific forms of human relationship. For example, all forms of social interaction involve a degree of cooperation and conflict. Sociology studies the ways in which these general characteristics are expressed in different forms of social interaction.

Second, it can mean that sociology studies the **specific characteristics** of social phenomena. For example, sociology studies the specific ways in which two people interact with each other in a friendship. This interpretation of Simmel's claim is more in line with the traditional understanding of sociology as the study of society.

## Conclusion

Simmel's sociology of forms is a powerful tool for understanding social phenomena. It allows us to see the underlying structure of social relationships and how they shape our thoughts and feelings. Simmel's work has had a profound impact on the development of sociological theory and social psychology.

**Metaphor:**

Sociology is like a sculptor who studies the forms of different types of clay. The sculptor does not care about the specific content of the clay, but rather the way in which it is shaped. In the same way, sociologists do not care about the specific content of social interactions, but rather the way in which they are structured.## Summary

This text discusses two interpretations of Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology." The first interpretation leads to the conclusion that sociology is a generalizing science, which contradicts Simmel's pretensions of building sociology as a specific science. The second interpretation is meaningless and inapplicable to social phenomena.

## Context

Simmel was a German sociologist who is considered one of the founders of sociology. He developed the concept of the "formal sociology" as a way to study social phenomena without relying on metaphysical or psychological assumptions. Simmel argued that sociology should be a science that studies the forms of social interaction, rather than the content of those interactions.

## Key Concepts and Figures

The key concepts in this text are Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" and the two interpretations of this concept. The figures in this text are Simmel himself and the two interpreters of his concept of the "formal sociology."

## Contributions and Implications

Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" has been influential in the development of sociology. It has been used to study a wide range of social phenomena, from interpersonal interactions to large-scale social organizations. The two interpretations of Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" have also been influential, although they have been criticized for leading to contradictory conclusions.

## Significance and Impact

Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" is significant because it has helped to shape the development of sociology as a discipline. It has also been influential in the study of a wide range of social phenomena. The two interpretations of Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" have also been influential, although they have been criticized for leading to contradictory conclusions.

## Metaphor

Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" can be compared to a microscope. A microscope allows us to see things that we would not be able to see with the naked eye. In the same way, Simmel's concept of the "formal sociology" allows us to see the underlying forms of social interaction that would not be apparent if we only looked at the content of those interactions.## Formal Sociology

Formal sociology is a school of sociology that focuses on the forms of social interaction, rather than the content of those interactions. It is based on the idea that the forms of social interaction are more important than the content of those interactions in determining how society works.

## Key Concepts

* **Social interaction:** The process by which people communicate and interact with each other.
* **Form:** The structure or pattern of social interaction.
* **Content:** The meaning or substance of social interaction.

## Key Figures

* **Georg Simmel:** One of the founders of formal sociology. Simmel argued that the forms of social interaction are more important than the content of those interactions in determining how society works. He developed a number of concepts to describe the different forms of social interaction, such as conflict, competition, and cooperation.
* **Talcott Parsons:** Another important figure in formal sociology. Parsons developed a theory of social action that focused on the different ways in which people interact with each other. He argued that the forms of social interaction are determined by the social structure and culture of a society.

## Contributions and Implications

Formal sociology has made a number of important contributions to the field of sociology. It has helped to develop a more systematic understanding of the different forms of social interaction. It has also helped to show how the forms of social interaction are related to the social structure and culture of a society.

The implications of formal sociology are far-reaching. It has implications for our understanding of how society works, how people interact with each other, and how social change occurs. It also has implications for our understanding of the role of sociology in society.

## Conclusion

Formal sociology is a valuable tool for understanding how society works. It provides a systematic way of studying the different forms of social interaction and how they are related to the social structure and culture of a society. This understanding can help us to make sense of the world around us and to develop strategies for social change.

**Metaphor:** Formal sociology is like a microscope that allows us to see the different forms of social interaction in detail. It helps us to understand how these forms of interaction are related to each other and to the social structure and culture of a society.## 2. Simmel's definition of sociology as the study of forms of human relationship is problematic because it is too broad and encompasses both processes of socialization and dissociation.

Simmel's definition of sociology as the study of forms of human relationship is problematic because it is too broad and encompasses both processes of socialization and dissociation. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn the norms and values of their society, while dissociation is the process by which individuals withdraw from social interaction. These two processes are fundamentally different, and it is therefore problematic to lump them together under the same heading.

## Socialization

Socialization is the process by which individuals learn the norms and values of their society. This process begins in childhood, as children learn the language and customs of their culture. It continues throughout life, as individuals learn new roles and adapt to new situations. Socialization is essential for human survival, as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to function in society.

## Dissociation

Dissociation is the process by which individuals withdraw from social interaction. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as mental illness, trauma, or social isolation. Dissociation can be a temporary or permanent condition, and it can have a significant impact on an individual's life.

## Problems with Simmel's definition

Simmel's definition of sociology as the study of forms of human relationship is problematic because it encompasses both socialization and dissociation. These two processes are fundamentally different, and it is therefore difficult to study them under the same heading. For example, a sociologist who is studying socialization would be interested in the ways in which individuals learn the norms and values of their society. A sociologist who is studying dissociation would be interested in the ways in which individuals withdraw from social interaction. These two studies would require different methods and approaches, and it would be difficult to integrate them into a single research project.

## Conclusion

Simmel's definition of sociology as the study of forms of human relationship is problematic because it is too broad and encompasses both socialization and dissociation. These two processes are fundamentally different, and it is therefore difficult to study them under the same heading. A more precise definition of sociology would focus on one of these processes, or it would distinguish between them in a way that would allow them to be studied together.

## Metaphor

Sociology is like a microscope that can be used to study different aspects of human relationships. Socialization is like the study of cells under a microscope, while dissociation is like the study of bacteria under a microscope. Both cells and bacteria are important parts of the human body, but they are studied in different ways because they are fundamentally different. Similarly, socialization and dissociation are important aspects of human relationships, but they are studied in different ways because they are fundamentally different.## Georg Simmel's Sociology

Georg Simmel (1858-1918) was a German sociologist who is considered one of the founders of modern sociology. His work focused on the relationship between individuals and society, and he developed a number of sociological concepts that are still used today, such as the stranger, the metropolis, and fashion.

### Key Concepts

* **Form and content:** Simmel argued that the form of a social interaction is more important than its content. For example, he argued that the way in which people interact in a city is more important than the specific things they talk about.
* **The stranger:** Simmel argued that the stranger is a key figure in modern society. The stranger is someone who is not part of the group but who is also not completely foreign to it. The stranger can provide a new perspective on society and can help to challenge its norms and values.
* **The metropolis:** Simmel argued that the metropolis is a unique type of social environment. The metropolis is characterized by its size, density, and heterogeneity. The metropolis can be a challenging environment for individuals, but it can also provide opportunities for personal growth and development.
* **Fashion:** Simmel argued that fashion is a social phenomenon that reflects the changing values of society. Fashion is a way for individuals to express their individuality and to connect with others.

### Contributions and Implications

Simmel's work has had a significant impact on the development of sociology. His concepts of form and content, the stranger, the metropolis, and fashion have been used by sociologists to understand a wide range of social phenomena. Simmel's work has also been influential in other fields, such as philosophy, psychology, and art history.

### Criticisms

Simmel's work has been criticized for being too abstract and lacking in scientific rigor. Some critics have argued that Simmel's concepts are notfalsifiable and that his method of sociological analysis is too speculative.

### Conclusion

Simmel was a pioneering sociologist who made a significant contribution to the development of the field. His work is still relevant today and continues to be used by sociologists to understand a wide range of social phenomena.

**Metaphor:** Simmel's sociology can be compared to a kaleidoscope. Just as a kaleidoscope can create beautiful and complex patterns from a few simple pieces of glass, so too can Simmel's sociology create insights into society from a few simple concepts.## Formal Sociology

Formal sociology is a school of thought that emphasizes the development of abstract sociological theories that are not based on empirical data. Proponents of formal sociology argue that sociology should be a theoretical science, and that empirical data should be used to test theoretical models, rather than to develop theories.

**Key Concepts**

* Abstraction: The process of removing specific details from a phenomenon in order to focus on its general features.
* Formal theory: A theory that is expressed in abstract terms and is not based on empirical data.
* Empirical data: Data that is collected through observation or experimentation.
* Sociology: The study of human society.

**Key Figures**

* Émile Durkheim: French sociologist who is considered to be one of the founders of formal sociology. Durkheim argued that sociology should be a scientific discipline that is based on empirical data.
* Max Weber: German sociologist who is also considered to be one of the founders of formal sociology. Weber argued that sociology should be a value-free science that is based on objective analysis.
* Talcott Parsons: American sociologist who was a major proponent of formal sociology. Parsons developed a complex theoretical framework for understanding social systems.

**Contributions**

Formal sociology has made a number of important contributions to the field of sociology. These contributions include:

* The development of abstract theoretical models that have helped to explain social phenomena.
* The emphasis on the importance of empirical data in testing sociological theories.
* The development of a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of sociology.

**Implications**

The work of formal sociologists has had a significant impact on the development of sociology as a discipline. Formal sociology has helped to make sociology more scientific and rigorous, and has also led to the development of a number of important theoretical models.

**Comparison with Other Schools of Thought**

Formal sociology is often contrasted with other schools of thought in sociology, such as symbolic interactionism and social constructionism. Symbolic interactionism emphasizes the importance of subjective meaning in social interaction, while social constructionism emphasizes the role of language and culture in shaping social reality. Formal sociology, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of objective structures and processes in shaping social behavior.

**Conclusion**

Formal sociology is a school of thought that has made a significant contribution to the development of sociology as a discipline. Formal sociology emphasizes the development of abstract theoretical models that are not based on empirical data, and the importance of empirical data in testing sociological theories. Formal sociology has helped to make sociology more scientific and rigorous, and has also led to the development of a number of important theoretical models.

**Metaphor**

Formal sociology can be compared to a building. The foundation of the building is the abstract theoretical models that are developed by formal sociologists. The walls of the building are the empirical data that is used to test these theories. The roof of the building is the more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of sociology that has been developed by formal sociologists.## Introduction

There is no science that is independent and uncontaminated by data from other sciences. The most important books in cultural, psychological, and social sciences are those that are rich in a mixture of data from various sciences.

## The Formal School of Sociology

The author argues that there is no need for a "pure sociology" that is separate from other social sciences. He believes that all social sciences are interrelated and that the attempt to create a separate sociology is futile. He also argues that the formal school of sociology has not produced anything of value and that its attempts to classify social relationships are not helpful.

## The Formal School Did Not Initiate the Classification of Social Relations and Processes

The formal school did not initiate the classification of social relations and processes. Tarde and Spencer had already done it before.

## The Formal School Does Not Represent a Monopoly

The formal school does not represent a monopoly. There is no consensus on the definition and classification of social processes and human relations in sociology. Some sociologists do not attempt to give a formal systematic classification, while others do. The basis of the classification used by sociologists is different. The majority of the systematic classifications go on along the lines of the classifications offered by Herbert Spencer and Gabriel Tarde.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the author argues that there is no need for a "pure sociology" that is separate from other social sciences. He believes that all social sciences are interrelated and that the attempt to create a separate sociology is futile. He also argues that the formal school of sociology has not produced anything of value and that its attempts to classify social relationships are not helpful.### The Classification of Social Relations and Processes in Sociology

The classification of social relations and processes is a complex and challenging task. There is no one agreed-upon system, and different sociologists have proposed their own methods.

One common approach is to classify social relations based on their **form**. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by their degree of formality, their symmetry, or their temporality.

Another approach is to classify social relations based on their **content**. This can be done by their function, their type of interaction, or their underlying emotion.

Finally, social relations can also be classified based on their **structure**. This can be done by their size, their complexity, or their degree of stratification.

No matter how they are classified, social relations are an essential part of human society. They are the foundation of our social interactions, and they play a key role in our individual and collective well-being.

**Metaphor:** Social relations can be thought of as the building blocks of society. Just as a house is made up of bricks, so too is society made up of social relations. These relations provide the structure and support that allow society to function.## Introduction

Sociology is the study of human society and social interaction. It is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the study of small groups to the study of large-scale social institutions. In order to understand the complex interactions that occur within society, sociologists need to develop a systematic way of classifying social processes and human relations.

## Existing Classifications

There are a number of different ways to classify social processes and human relations. One common approach is to use the following four dimensions:

* **Structure:** The way in which social relationships are organized.
* **Function:** The purpose or goal of social relationships.
* **Process:** The way in which social relationships change over time.
* **Content:** The specific content of social interactions.

Another approach is to use the following three types of social relationships:

* **Primary relationships:** Close, personal relationships that are based on affection and trust.
* **Secondary relationships:** More impersonal relationships that are based on shared interests or goals.
* **Tertiary relationships:** Relationships that are based on formal roles or obligations.

## The Need for a Systematics of Social Processes and Human Relations

While these existing classifications provide a useful starting point, they are not perfect. They can be difficult to apply to complex social interactions, and they often do not take into account the dynamic nature of social relationships.

## A Proposed Systematics of Social Processes and Human Relations

In this paper, I propose a new systematics of social processes and human relations that is based on the following four principles:

* **Social processes and human relations are complex and dynamic.** They are constantly changing and evolving, and they can never be fully understood in a static way.
* **Social processes and human relations are multi-dimensional.** They can be classified along a number of different dimensions, including structure, function, process, and content.
* **Social processes and human relations are interdependent.** They are all interconnected and influence each other in complex ways.
* **Social processes and human relations are shaped by the social context.** The specific nature of social processes and human relations is determined by the social, cultural, and historical context in which they occur.

I believe that this new systematics of social processes and human relations will provide a more comprehensive and accurate way of understanding the complex interactions that occur within society.

## Conclusion

Sociology is the study of human society and social interaction. In order to understand the complex interactions that occur within society, sociologists need to develop a systematic way of classifying social processes and human relations. This paper proposes a new systematics of social processes and human relations that is based on the following four principles:

* **Social processes and human relations are complex and dynamic.**
* **Social processes and human relations are multi-dimensional.**
* **Social processes and human relations are interdependent.**
* **Social processes and human relations are shaped by the social context.**

I believe that this new systematics of social processes and human relations will provide a more comprehensive and accurate way of understanding the complex interactions that occur within society.

## Metaphor

Social processes and human relations can be thought of as a complex web of interconnected relationships. Each relationship is like a thread in the web, and the overall web represents the structure of society. The web is constantly changing and evolving, as new relationships are formed and old ones are broken. The specific nature of the web is determined by the social, cultural, and historical context in which it exists.**Social Processes**

Social processes are the actions and interactions that occur between people in society. They are the building blocks of social structure and culture, and they play a key role in shaping our lives.

There are many different types of social processes, but some of the most common include:

* **Communication:** The exchange of information between people.
* **Conflict:** The struggle between people or groups over resources or power.
* **Cooperation:** The joint effort of people to achieve a common goal.
* **Culture:** The shared beliefs, values, and norms of a group of people.
* **Socialization:** The process by which people learn the norms and values of their society.

Social processes are constantly evolving and changing, as society itself changes. They are also influenced by a variety of factors, including culture, economics, and politics.

**Problems with the Classification of Social Processes**

There are a number of problems with the current classification of social processes.

* **Many social processes lack clear definitions.** For example, what exactly is meant by "conflict"? Is it the same as "competition"? Or is it something different?
* **The classifications do not discriminate between permanent and universal processes and particular and temporary processes.** For example, the process of socialization is a permanent and universal process, while the process of conflict is a particular and temporary process.

**Conclusion**

The classification of social processes is a complex and challenging task. However, it is an important one, as it can help us to better understand the world around us.

**Metaphor:**

Social processes can be thought of as the gears in a machine. They are the mechanisms that drive society forward and make it work. Just as a machine cannot function without its gears, so too society cannot function without its social processes.**Sociological Theories**

Sociology is the study of society and social behavior. There are many different sociological theories, each with its own unique perspective on how society works.

**Functionalist Theory**

Functionalist theory is one of the most influential sociological theories. It argues that society is a system of interdependent parts, each of which plays a role in maintaining the whole. Functionalists believe that society is held together by shared values and norms, and that social problems are caused by a breakdown in these shared values.

**Conflict Theory**

Conflict theory is another major sociological theory. It argues that society is not a harmonious system, but rather a place of conflict and struggle. Conflict theorists believe that social inequality is the root of social problems, and that the only way to create a just society is to eliminate inequality.

**Symbolic Interactionism**

Symbolic interactionism is a micro-level sociological theory that focuses on how individuals interact with each other and how these interactions create meaning. Symbolic interactionists believe that society is created through our interactions with others, and that our understanding of the world is shaped by our social interactions.

**Other Sociological Theories**

There are many other sociological theories, including feminist theory, postmodernist theory, and critical theory. Each of these theories offers a unique perspective on society and social behavior.

**Conclusion**

Sociological theories are important tools for understanding society and social behavior. They can help us to understand the causes of social problems, and to develop solutions to these problems.

**Metaphor**

Sociology is like a telescope. It allows us to see the world in a new way, and to understand the complex forces that shape our society.
