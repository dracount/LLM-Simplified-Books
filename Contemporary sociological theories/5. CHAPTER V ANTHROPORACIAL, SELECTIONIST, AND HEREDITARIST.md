school of sociology. I. PREDECESSORS   The factors of race, selection, and of heredity were known long  ago. In The Sacred Books of the East we find many statements  which stress their role. In the pract ices of ancient societies,  ''blood," "race," and ''selection" were given an exclusive  importance, determining the social status, both of individuals and  of groups. The ancient social stratification of castes and classes,  of the aristocracy and slaves, of t he plebeians and the patricians,  and of the noble and the humble, was based principally on "blood"  and "race." Accordingly, ancient societies practiced very  extensively what is now styled "eugenics." Following are a few of  the many examples found in the so urce literature of these  societies.   In the Sacred Books of India we find the theory that the different  castes were created out of different parts of the body of Brahma,  and that they are innately different; consequently, any mixture of  blood, or cross -marriage, or even any contact of the members of  different races is the greatest crime, and the social status of every  individual is entirely determined by the "blood" of his parents.  There are also a great many purely eugenic prescriptions aimed  to keep the pu rity of the blood, to facilitate the procreation of the  best elements in the population, and to check       that of the unhealthy. -^ In other words, eugenics was well known  and widely practiced in ancient societies.   'Twice-born men (of the higher castes) who, in their folly, wed  wives of the low caste, soon degrade their families and their  children to the state of Sudras." ''He who weds a Siadra woman  becomes an outcast" (with whom any contact becomes  impossible). "A Bra hmana who takes a Sudra wife to his bed will  (after death) sink into hell; if he begets a child by her he will lose  the rank of a Brahmana" (be automatically excluded from the  upper caste). The manes and the gods will not eat the offerings of  that man. "Fo r him who drinks the moisture of a Sudra's lips, who  is tainted by her breath, and who begets a son by her, no  expiation is prescribed." (Such a sin is unforgivable.) Further, it is  prescribed that one should avoid taking a wife from the families in  which no male children are born, where there are hemorrhoids,  phthisis, weakness of digestion, epilepsy, leprosy; when a maiden  has red eyes, and so on. "In the blameless marriages, blameless  children are born to men; in the blameable marriages, blameable  offspr ing. One should avoid the blameable marriages." ^ Such are  a few of the many eugenic prescriptions long ago practiced in  ancient India.   In the Bible also we find many endogamic rules aimed to preserve  the. purity of blood or race among the Jews.   A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to  the tenth generations shall none of his enter into the assembly of  Jehovah.^   Ye shall not give your daughters unto their [Gentile] sons, nor  take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.*   Trans gression of this is styled by Ezra as "mingling of the holy  seeds with the people of the land," and is strongly prohibited."''   In the Odyssey and Iliad there are also many places which stress  the importance of blood purity:   See Laws of Manu, Chaps. I, II , III, IV; Apastamha, Prasna I, II;  Gautama, Chap. X; Nardda, XII; The Institutes of Vishnu, II, III, in  The Sacred Books of the East.   Laws of Manu, II, 6 -42. See other indicated Sacred Books of  India.

The anthropo-racial school in sociology emphasizes the importance of race, heredity, and selection in explaining social phenomena. The most famous and influential theory in this school is the racial theory of Gobineau, which argues that the Aryan race is superior to all others. Other important theories in this school include the hereditarist school of Francis Galton and K. Pearson and the selectionist theories of V. de Lapouge and Otto Ammon.This is a summary of Count Gobineau's racial interpretation of history.A. Collins's book "The Inequality of Human Races" summarizes Gobineau's work on the topic.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECT IONIST, HEREDITARIST 223   Gobineau takes the problem of the development and decay of  societies. What are the causes of such phenomena? What factors  determine either an upward movement of society and civilization  or their decay? With a great erudition for hi s time, he takes the  existing hypotheses one after another and shows their  inadequacy. Having characterized society in a manner "more or  less perfect from the political, and quite complete from the social  point of view, as a union of men who live under the  direction of  similar ideas and who have identical instincts," ^^ Gobineau  shows that neither religious fanaticism, nor corruption and  licentiousness, nor luxury leads necessarily to decay, as many  authors thought. The Aztec Empire was religiously fanatica l and  was accustomed even to sacrifice human beings to their gods; yet  this did not lead to its decay, but rather facilitated a long historical  existence of this society. The upper classes of Greece, Rome,  Persia, Venice, Genoa, England, and Russia lived i n luxury for  many centuries, yet this did not lead to their decay. The same  may be said of corruption. The earliest ascending stages of  ancient Rome, Sparta, and many other societies were far from  being virtuous and honest. The early Romans were cruel and  pitiless; the Spartans and Phcjenicians used to rob, plunder, rape,  and lie. They exhibited the greatest corruption; yet this did not  hinder these societies from rising and prospering. 'Tt is not in  virtue that we find the cause of their vigour at the earl iest stages  of their history." On the other hand, in the period of decay, many  societies exhibit an increase of humanitarianism, softening of  mores, a decrease of cruelty, corruption, and brutality, and yet  this does not stop their decay. Finally, througho ut the history of  France and other countries there has been much fluctuation in the  amount of corruption, with nothing showing a drift toward decay in  the more corrupt periods. For these reasons it is evident that  corruption cannot account for decay. Simil arly, religious decay is  not a sufficient cause to explain it. Persia, Tyre, Carthage and  Judea fell down when their religion was very intensive. Even in  Greece and Rome, religion, especially among the masses of the  population, was quite strong in the peri od of decay. These and  "Gobineau, Essai sur rincgalite des races hurnainrs, Vol. I, pp. 11 - 12.      similar inductions show that ''it is impossible to explain a people's  ruin through their irreligion." ^"^   Neither do the merits of a government influence the historical  longevity of societies. Bad governments may be classified as  those which are foreign, and those which are imposed by foreign,  degenerate, and class -selfish governments. China had, for  thousands  of years, a foreign (the Mongol) government, and yet,  in spite of this fact, China exists and has often shown great social  progress. England was conquered by the foreign Normans, and  yet this did not ruin England. Furthermore, we know that societies  with a degenerated, or class -selfish government have continued  to exist in spite of these conditions. These, and similar historical  inductions testify that national decay cannot be accounted for  through the character of the government.^^ In this way Gobineau  shows the insuf^ciency of all these theories. This does not mean  that he does not attribute any influence to these factors. He does,  but only as to their facilitating the condition brought about. These  phenomena may lead to decay only when they are a  manifes tation of some deeper cause.   After clearing the ground, Gobineau offers his own theory. It  consists of the statement that the fundamental factor of the  progress or decay of a society is the racial factor.   Going from one induction to another I came to the c onclusion chat  ethnical (racial) problems dominate all other problems of history. It  is the key to them; and inequality of races is sufficient to explain  the entire enchainment of the destinies of peoples. ^^   Understanding by the decay or degeneration of a  nation the fact  ''that the people do not have as much inner valour as they had  before," the cause of such a degeneration is that "the people do  not have the same blood in their veins any more because through  successive cross -marriages, its value has been changed, and  they have not been able to preserve the race of their founders."  Correspondingly, "a people and their civilization dies out when the  people's fundamental racial constitution is changed or engulfed  among other races to the degree that it ceases  to exert the  necessary influence." As soon as such conditions are given, the  mortal
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST 225   hour of a society and of its civilization is struck.^' The purity of a  race, if the race is talented, is the condition absolutely necessary  for preventing the decay of the society and of its civilization. Such  a people is potentially immortal. If they are conquered by an  invader, they, like the Chinese under the Mongols, or the Hindus  under the Englishmen, can avoid decay,  can preserve their  civilization, and, sooner or later, will restore their independence.  On the other hand, racial mixture leads to degeneration, even  though the society has the most brilliant culture created by its  ancestors. So it happened with the Greek s and the Romans. They  could not maintain the purity of their race in the later stages of  their history, and therefore, in spite of a wonderful culture they  decayed. ^^   This leads Gobineau to his second proposition about the  inequality of human races. They  are unequal. There are the  superior and the inferior races. The former are capable of  progress; the latter are hopeless. Civilization and culture have  been created by the superior races exclusively, and each type of  culture is nothing but a manifestation of racial qualities. To  corroborate this statement, Gobineau gives a long series of  proofs. The inequality of races is proved by the fact that up to the  present time there are many races, which in spite of many  thousand years of existence still remain at t he most primitive  stages of culture. They have not been able to create anything  valuable, or to progress in spite of the different environments in  which they have been existing. Their creative sterility is due to  their racial inferiority rather than to the  environmental factors.  "The majority of races are forever incapable of being civilized"  and "no environmental agency can fertilize their organic sterility."  Such is the statement of the author. This naturally leads him to a  criticism of various theories w hich have tried to account for racial  differences and differences in cultural development through  environmental factors, especially through their geographic  environment. "The progress or stagnation of a people does not  depend upon geographic conditions," s ays Gobineau. Partizans  of this theory used to say that people placed in a favorable  geographic environment progress, while the people who stay  among unfavorable geographic conditions are   '^ I hid., pp. 39 -40, '"* Ihid.f p. 53. -
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** CONTEMPORARY SOCIOL OGICAL THEORIES   stagnant. The author states that history does not corroborate such  a theory. The environment of America was very favorable, and yet  the aboriginal races of America, —except three races of South  America, —could not create any great civilizat ion, but remained in  the primitive stages. On the other hand, the environment of Egypt,  or Athens, or Sparta, or Assyria, was far from being favorable. It  was poor and unfertile until artificial irrigation and other measures  were created. And yet, in spite  of the unfavorable conditions,  these races, thanks to their inner genius, modified their natural  environment, and created brilliant civilizations. The same  independence of culture from the environment is shown by the  fact that we find the progressive peop les under the most different  geographical environments. The same is true in regard to  stagnant races. Finally, the absence of any close correlation  between the character of the races and that of geographic  environment is witnessed by the fact that, in the same  environment in one period there exists a brilliant civilization, and  in another period, it disappears, being superseded by a stagnant  and incapable people. If geographic conditions were responsible  for the progress or stagnation of a people, such thin gs could not  take place. Going in this inductive way and giving one fact after  another, Gobineau skilfully shows that "geographical theories"  cannot give any satisfactory explanation of the racial and cultural  differences of peoples.^^   The next criticism o f the author is directed against the theories  which try to account, for Ihe differences of various peoples by  social environment, —that is, through the character of the social  and political institutions. Gobineau indicates that these theories I  are wrong a lso. In the first place, because institutions and laws I  themselves are only manifestations of racial traits, not their i  causes. They are created by the people according to their inner  qualities, but the people do not create these qualities. The  instituti ons do not fall from the heaven as something ready -made.  Neither do they exist before the existence of the peoples with their  inner qualities. When laws or institutions, quite heterogeneous to  the racial instincts of a people, are compulsorily introduced b y a  foreign nation, or by a conqueror, or by a radical reformer, they  ^'•^ Gobineau, Essai sur Vinegalite, Chap. VI.    usually do not have any success, but remain on paper,  representing a mere decoration. Sometimes, when a race cannot  resist such innovat ions, it dies, like many primitive people who  have been unable to adapt themselves to such a heterogeneous  culture. Even a pure imitation of a foreign culture or institutions is  possible only when, in the veins of an imitating race, there is a  part of the blood of the people whom they imitate. The negroes of  America ' can imitate some superficial cultural traits of the white  race only because in their veins there is already a considerable  part of the white blood. The author gives again a long series of  facts of this kind, and concludes that the discussed theories  cannot give any satisfactory explanation of the differences  brought about in various peoples through the social  environment.^^ From this viewpoint he analyzes in a detailed form  the role of religion , and especially the role of Christianity, in order  to show that even this environmental factor cannot explain the  differences of various peoples. Though Christianity is accepted by  different peoples, teaching them all the same ideas, nevertheless  it is fo rced to leave the institutions of these peoples untouched in  their essence. The Eskimo Christian remains Eskimo; the  Chinese Christian remains Chinese; the South American native  remains what he was; and all these different Christians remain  different from one another in spite of the identity of their religion.  This shows that unless religion is a direct manifestation of racial  instincts (in which case it cannot be universal and cosmopolitan) it  cannot change the racial qualities and explain the differences of  the races."^   After this critical part, Gobineau outlines his theory of the origin,  inequality, and social role of the racial factor. The three volumes  of his work are practically devoted to the development of this  theory. Jts essence is as follows: Besi des the above argu - \  ments, the fact of racial inequality is corroborated by, and is par - I  tially due to, the probable heterogeneous origin of different races.  In this way, he was one of the first authors who set forth the  theory of the heterogeneous ori gin of different races, —the theory  stressed later on by Gumplowicz and many anthropologists. Since  different races sprang from different sources, it is natural that they  are, and nnist be, diff'erent, especially in the early stages 20 Ibid.,  Chap. V. ^'i I bid., Chap. VII.    2^8    of their history, when they were purer than they now are. In spite  of a long course of history, and a great mixture of blood, even  now the ra
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** ces are still different anatomically, physiologically, and  psychologically. Such differences are permanent and coul d not be  obliterated by any environmental factors. Only cross -marriage or  mixture of blood may change racial characteristics. At the  beginning of human history there existed three pure, principal  races : the white, the yellow, and the black. All other raci al  varieties have been nothing but a mixture of these fundamental  races. Of them the most talented and creative was the white race,  especially its Aryan branch. In its pure form this race has  performed real miracles. It has been practically the creator of all  the ten principal civilizations known in the history of mankind. Six  of them, namely, —the Hindu, the Egyptian, the Assyrian, the  Greek, the Roman, and the Teuton civilizations, were created by  the Aryans, who represent the highest branch of the white r ace.  The remaining four civilizations, — the Chinese, Mexican,  Peruvian, and Maya, were founded and created by other  branches of the white race, mixed with outside races. This white  race expanded and conquered other races, but, at the same time,  amalgamated  with them. From this amalgamation came different  racial groups and corresponding civilizations, but the more the  amalgamation progressed the more the white race lost its  precious qualities, and the more its various branches (like the  Greek or the Roman) d egenerated. At the time of Jesus Christ the  first and the most brilliant part of the history of mankind had been  completed. At that time the amalgamation of races had already  reached a considerable proportion. Since this period, and up to  the present time,  it has been progressing, with some fluctuations.  The result of such race -blending is a tendency to decay, which  has been shown in the history of the last few centuries. It  expresses itself in many forms, and one of these is the progress  of egalitarian ide as, democratic movements, and the blending of  cultures, which, however, does not show anything of that  brightness and genius which stamped the previous great  civilizations created by relatively pure races. The future prospects  drawn by Gobineau are natural ly not very hopeful, — blood -

After the age of the gods, when the Aryan race was a bsolutely  pure; and the age of heroes when race -blending was slight in  form and number, it began, during the age of nobles, to slowly  progress. After this age, race -mixture advanced rapidly . . .  towards a great confusion of all racial elements and through   numerous inter -racial marriages.   The result of such a progress will be a greater and greater  similarity of human beings on the one hand, and on the other an  increasing mediocrity of men's physical constitutions, of their  beauty, and of their mind. Here we  have the real triumph of  mediocrity, since in this sorrowful inheritance (of race  amalgamation) everybody must participate in equal proportion  and there is no reason to expect that one would have a better fate  than another. Like the Polynesians, all men s hall be similar to one  another, —in their stature, in their traits, and in their habits.   Human herds, no longer nations, weighed down by a mournful  somnolence, will henceforth be benumbed in their nullity, like  buffaloes ruminating in the stagnant meres of the Pontine  marshes.   This means the death of society and the end of the whole human  civilization."   Such is the scheme and skeleton of the work of Gobineau.  Written brilliantly, with the charm of an excellent stylist, the  fascination of an original thinker,  and marked by clearness aixi  logicity of ideas, and finally, by unusual erudition, the book made,  and makes up to this time, a strong impression. It gave a great  impetus to many other racial theories, which will be mentioned  later. Postponing my criticism  of Gobineau's theory here, I shall  mention only that which is an appreciation of the theory. The  chapters of the book devoted to the criticism of different  environmental theories are still valid in their essential objections  to the environmentalism, and a re quite fresh even at the present  moment. Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855 -1926). —Among  the works which are similar to that of Gobineau in their method  and character, a conspicuous place belongs to the work of II. S.  Cham -^Ibid.. Vol. IV, pp. 318 -359; Vo l. I, Chaps. X. XI, XVI.       berlain : The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century}^ The son of  Admiral William Charles Chamberlain, born in 1855, the author  received an entirely foreign (principally German) education. He  travelled a great deal, and published several works such as Notes  sur Lohengrin, and Das Drama Richard Wagners. However, his  fame has been due to The Foundations of the Nineteenth  Century. In this historico -philosophical work, Chamberlain puts  and answe rs the problem: What are the foundations or the  sources of the civilization of the nineteenth century? The essence  of this answer is as follows: Contemporary civilization is  composed of four principal sources, namely, the contributions of  the Greek civiliz ation, of the Roman, of the Jewish, and of the  Teuton. From the Greeks we received poetry, art and philosophy;  from the Romans, law, statecraft, order, the idea of citizenship,  and the sanctity of the family and of property; while the Jews gave  us the elem ents of Judaism, and indirectly, of Christianity, besides  other good and bad legacies and influences which the Jews have  exerted since the moment of their entrance into Western history.  On the basis of these legacies the Teutons, —the term by which  Chamberl ain understands the Germans, the Celts, the Slavs, and  all the races of northern Europe from which the people of modern  Europe and of the United States of America have sprung, —have  shaped and created the Western civilization of the nineteenth  century.^^ Ea ch of these fundamental elements has been the  work of the racial genius of the above groups. Their specific  talents and contributions have been nothing but a manifestation of  their racial qualities. This leads Chamberlain to his theory of the  racial factor .  The human races are, in reality, as different from one another in  character, qualities, and above all, in the degree of their individual  capacities, as greyhound, bulldog, poodle and Newfoundland dog.  Has not every genuine race its glorious, incomparable   physiognomy? How could Hellenic art have arisen without  Hellenes? . . .

The man who belongs to a distinct, pure race, never loses the  sense of it. The guardian angel of his lineage is ever at his side,  supporting him where he loses his foothold, warning him where  he is in danger of going astray, comi)elling ol)edience, and forcing  him to undertakings which, deeming them impossible, he would  never have dared to attempt. Race lifts a man above himself: it  endows him with extraordinary —I might almost say  supernatural —powers. It is a fact of direct experience that the  quality of  the race is of vital importance. ^^   The author proceeds further to show that the various races are  different; that there are the superior and the inferior races; and  that their difference is due not to environment, but is innate. The  most superior race is  the white, —particularly the Aryan race, to  which in the past belonged the Greeks and the Romans, and at  the present, the Teutons in the above indicated sense of the  word. In these respects Chamberlain's theory is similar to that of  Gobineau. Only in regar d to the pure races does he differ from the  French author. As we know, Gobineau regarded any mixture of  the blood of a noble, pure race as its contamination. According to  Chamberlain,   This supposition rests upon total ignorance of the ]:)hysiological  impor tance of what we have to understand by "race." A noble  race does not fall from i feaven, it becomes noble gradually, and  this gradual process can begin anew at any moment. ^^   Not only the Jewish, but the Aryan, and the Teutonic races, all  emerged at the be ginning from a fortunate mixture of different  races. Such fortunate mixtures may take place in the future also.  Therefore this future need not be necessarily as pessimistic as it  was depicted by Gobineau."^ The principal conditions necessary  to create a no ble race through mixture are as follow^s: First, *'the  presence of excellent racial material. Where there is nothing, the  king has no right." Second, an inbreeding.   Such races as the Greeks, the Romans, the Franks, the  Swabians, the Italians, the S]xuiiar( ls in the period of their  splendour, the   2^^ IhuL, Vol. I, J)]). 261 -262, 269 -271 r/ srq.

They arise and they pass away before our eyes. Inbreeding  means the producing of descendants in the circle of the related  tribesmen, w ith the avoidance of all foreign mixture of blood.   Third, "artificial selection": that is, the elimination or hindering of  the procreation of the inferior part of a race and the facilitation of  that of the superior individuals. Fourth, the crossing of bloo d with  other homogeneous racial groups. Fifth, ''only quitf^ definite,  limited mixture of blood contributes towards the ennoblement of a  race, or, it may be, the origin of a new one." ^^ All known powerful  and noble races sprang up under the operation of t hese five  conditions.   Having given these principles. Chamberlain proceeds to his  detailed analysis of the race and the contributions of the Greeks  and the Romans. Beginning with the period of ''The Chaos," at the  beginning of the Middle Ages, he traces the  origin and  appearance of the Teutonic race; and the origin and entering of  the Jews into Western history. On the one hand, the author  admires the Jews for their preservation of racial purity, seeing in it  the source of the increasing power of the Jews. On  the other  hand, like Gobineau and many others, he stresses their  pernicious influence on our civilization. They remain always "the  aliens among all peoples." With the help of the princes and the  nobles who need their money, the Jews have always been the  cruel exploiters and merciless destroyers of all nations.   The Indo -European, moved by ideal motives, opened the gates in  friendship: the Jew rushed in like an enemy, stormed all positions  and planted the flag of his, to us, alien nature — I will not say on  the ruins, but on the breaches of our genuine individuality.  Wherever the Jews are admitted to power, they abuse it. -^  Owing to the humanitarianism, generosity, and disregard of the  racial problem on the part of the Indo -Europeans for the last  centuries, t he influence of the Jews has been increasing and our  time may be styled "The Jewish Age."

3. The racial-anthropometric branch of sociology.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** SCHOOL   Before mentioning other works which have stressed the racial  factor principally on the basis of his torical evidences, let us turn to  that branch of the school which has emphasized the importance  of the race factor, principally on the basis of the data of  anthropometry. The leading roles in this field have been played by  the works of a French anthropolog ist and biologist, G. Vasher de  Lapouge, and by a German anthropologist, Otto Amnion, not to       mention other names. Their works have given a great impetus to  the racial school, which tries to base its contentions on  a new  foundation, that is, on the data of anthropometry and biology.  Through their works, the conception of the superior and the  inferior races has become somewhat more definite. Let us briefly  outline the essentials of their works.   G. V. de Lapouge.^^ —Of his numerous researches, the most  important are summed up in his three books, the conclusions of  which are now given: Les selections sociales (Paris, 1896),  UAryen, son role social (Paris, 1899) and Race et milieu social  (Paris, 1909). In spite of the on e-sidedness of these works, they  belong to the type of books which are stamped by originality,  independence of opinion, and erudition. From the sociological  standpoint, the more interesting is the first book. It is opened with  a discussion of Darwinism in social sciences. In regard to race,  the author's starting point is that any population or any individual  has in its veins the blood of numerous and various races. The  number of the ancestors of every man, if they are traced back to  the time of Jesus Christ , is no less than 18,014, - S^2>^ZZ2>yZ?>2>y?)ZZ' I^ ^^ go further back, the number  rapidly increases to an unthinkable figure. This means that there  is no pure race in the absolute sense of the word.^^ This,  however, does not mean that there do not exist di fferent races in  a relative sense of the word. Many crossings are purely incidental  and cannot alter seriously either the purity of a race or its  dominant characteristics. This is ascertained by the existence of  races with different bodily, psychical, and physiological  characteristics.^'' The population of Europe consists of three  principal races, the word *'race" being taken in its zoological  sense. The first race is Homo Europaeiis, or the Aryan race. Its  characteristics are a tall stature (about im. 70),  conspicuously  dolichocephalic index, 76 and below, and blondness.  Corresponding psychological traits are as follows:   A dolichocephal has great wishes and incessantly works to satisfy   Concerning his works see Kovalevsky, M., Contemporary  Sociologists^ Chap.

There is nothing  that he does not dare to think or desire, and desire for him means  to realize it at once. Progress is his most intense need. In religion  he is a Protestant. In politics he demands from the State only the  respect of his activity, and tends rather to rise himself, than to  oppress others.^*''   The second principal race is the Homo Alpinus. His  characteristics include a stature of from im. 60 to  im. 65, and a  cephalic index of 85 and above. Pigmentation is brown or even  lighter. This is a typical man of the brachycephalic race:   He is frugal, laborious, remarkably prudent, and does not leave  anything to chance. Not lacking in courage, yet he does not have  a militant proclivity. He loves land and especially his native place.  Being rarely a nullity, at the same time he rarely rises to a level of  talent. His mental vistas are limited and he patiently works to  realize his moderate purposes. He is a man  of tradition and  common sense. He does not like progress. He adores uniformity.  In religion he prefers to be a Roman Catholic; in politics he craves  for State protection and interference, and for equality and  levelling. He sees excellently his personal in terests, and partly  those of his family, but the interests of the whole country are  beyond his mental perspective. ^^   The third race is Homo Contractus, or Mediterranean. He has a  low stature, dark color, and a cephalic index of about 78. He  represents som ething midway between the two above races.  According to his characteristics he must be ranked below even  Homo AlpinusP   Such are the principal racial types of the European population, the  most important racial characteristics of which are the cephalic  index  and pigmentation. The combination of these bodily traits is  connected with corresponding psychical and mental  characteristics. This correlation is so close that the author says:   The strength of a character depends upon the length of cranium  and brain. Whe n the cranium is less than 0.19, the race lacks

***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** energy. I3 -I4« ^ 17 -18. ^ 23 -28.      Such is the case with the brachycephahc race, which is  characterized by insufficiency of indiv iduahty and initiative.  Intellectual power, on the contrary, seems to be correlated with  the breadth of the anterior part of the brain. Certain  dolichocephals whose cephalic index is too low seem to be  incapable of rising above barbarism. I do not know any  superior  people whose cephalic index would be below 74. An interval of a  dozen units separates this limit of sufficient intelligence and  maximal energy from that where the energy is insufficient. ^^   Having given these racial characteristics, Lapouge proce eds to  show that practically all important achievements of culture have  been made by the Homo Eiiropaeiis, the Nordic, or the Aryan  race. They have been the leaders in every creative activity, and  otherwise the dominant race. Within the same society the up per  classes are composed predominantly of this race, while the lower  classes are composed of the other two races or their mixture.  There are racial differences, not only among various societies, but  among various social classes of the same society, too.  Correspondingly, the progress or regress of a society is  determined principally by changes in the racial composition of its  population. If the Nordic racial elements increase among it,  society progresses, but if, on the contrary, its proportion  decreases, —if, in other words, the cephalic index of the  population becomes less and less dolichocephalic, this will result  in a social regress and decay of the society.^^ These  generalizations are corroborated by various and different  anthropometrical data. They are i ntended to show that the  cephalic index of the ancient aristocracy (and partly even of the  contemporary one) has been low^er (more dolichocephalic) than  that of the lower social classes; that a more progressive city  population has a more dolichocephalic in dex than that of a more  backward country population; that in Greece and in Rome,  parallel to the development of decay, the cephalic index of the  population had been rising; that among contemporary societies,  the most progressive have been those, in which, as in England  and the United States of America, the population has been rich in  the Nordic elements; that in France and in other countries during  the last few centuries, a decrease of
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST 237   the Nordic elements in the population has been accompanied by  the process of decay; and so on. (See the Social selections and  VAryen, passim.) On the basis of these data of anthropometry,  Lapouge comes to conclusions similar to those of Gobineau about  the role of the racial f actor in the evolution of a country and a  civilization.   Having formulated these conclusions, the author asked how these  changes in the racial composition of a population could have  happened. What factors are responsible for them? Why is it that a  dolichoce phalic race could not and cannot keep its own proportion  within many societies ? The answer to these questions leads us  to the second, and from my point of view, to the more valuable  part of the theory of Lapouge, —that is, his theory of social  selection.   Changes in the population are possible either through the direct  influence of environmental agencies which may modify, step by  step, the bodily and mental traits of a population; or through  selection, —that is, through a progressive decrease of certain  racia l elements and a progressive multiplication of other racial  (hereditary) types in the population. The first way does not lead  directly to a change of the racial (hereditary) type, but it may lead  to it in a long period of time. The other way may change the  racial  (hereditary) composition of the population very efficiently, and in a  relatively short period of time. In order to show this, the author  analyzes the principal environmental agencies. He takes  education and tries to show that its efficiency in this  respect is  very limited. It cannot change the race and the inherited traits of  the population. It cannot make out of an innately stupid man, a  talented one; out of an inborn idiot, an averagely intelligent man;  or out of mediocrity, a genius. The best tha t education can do is to  raise the mental level of mediocrity a little. But even in this respect  its possibilities are limited. The importance of heredity is shown in  the fact that education does not diminish the differences between  individuals, but rather  increases them. If a mediocre talent gains  something by education, hereditary talent gains still more, so that  after the education, the difference between the former and the  latter increases, but does not decrease. Education, furthermore, is  incapable of changing the tempera -      ment, the character, and the moral traits of people. This is  witnessed by the fact that, in spite of a great increase of schools  and educational institutions, the number of crimes has not  diminished, but has rather increased. The cranial capacity also  has not increased, but rather decreased during the last few  decades. Finally, the results of education are not inherited;  therefore, its fruits cannot be transmitted and fixed into posterity.  These considerations must show that the educational factor is  very l imited in its efficiency to transform the race of a people.   More efficient is the influence of climate, as an environmental  agency. Important also are the modifying agencies of food,  alcohol, intermarriage, and some other environmental agencies in  the alte ration of the racial type of the population. Taken  independently of selection, however, they would require hundreds  of years to perform a noticeable change in the racial type of a  people. For this reason their direct efficiency is limited. If it is  somewha t greater, this is due to the indirect influence exerted  through the channels of selection.''^ ^The most important, rapid,  and efficient way of changing the racial composition of a  population is not by the direct influence of environment, but by a  selectio n which will lead to a survival and multiplication of one  racial type, and to the extermination of another type. Through  selection, the proportions of different racial types in a population  may be changed greatly, and within relatively a few generations. I f  we imagine two different families, one producing four surviving  children in each generation and the other only three offspring, —  then in the course of about three hundred years, the total  population will be 93 per cent the offspring of the first family, and  per cent that of the second.'*^ This shows how rapidly the factor  of selection works, and how efficient it is in changing the racial  composition of a population. The degeneration or improvement of  society has been due not so much to the direct influe nce of  environment as to the factor of selection.   This leads to Lapouge's analysis of selection. He accepts  Darwin's theory of natural selection and the evolution of  organisms through the play of this factor, or through the  elimination of the unfit and sur vival of the fittest. Among human  beings,
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST 239   however, he beHeves natural selection gives more and more  place to social selection, natural environment being gradually  superseded by social milieu. Therefore, n atural selection is  transformed into a social one, that is, the selection which goes on  under the influence not so much of natural, as of social  environment."*^ In the subsequent parts of his book, Lapouge  analyzes the principal forms and effects of social  selection within  the past and especially in the present societies. As natural  selection may be progressive and regressive, so may social  selection lead to a degeneration or to a betterment of the racial  (hereditary) composition of the population. Its domi nant effects,  however, are negative within present societies.   The first fundamental form of social selection is military, or the  selection caused by war. Contrary to general opinion, Lapouge  contends that wars do not decrease, but increase with the  progres s of civilization. Man is more warlike than any animal and  contemporary man is more warlike than prehistoric man. With the  exception of primitive times, war carries away the best racial  elements of the population, —the healthiest, the strongest, the  bravest , and the most audacious dolichocephals, —in much  greater proportion than the inferior and the brachycephalic  population. It facilitates the elimination of the belligerent Aryans  and the survival of the Alpine or the Mediterranean races. In this  military wa y the Aryans of ancient Greece and Rome, and the  Nordic nobility of Gallia and of the Middle Ages perished to a  great extent. As the Nordics are more belligerent and  independent, they have been the greatest sufferers from war.  Hence, if the fertility of th ese racial elements does not  compensate for the losses of war, or should their propagation be  retarded in comparison with that of other races, war leads to  degeneration, that is, an extermination of the Aryan race in a  society.'*"*   The second form of socia l selection is political, performed under  the influence of political factors and political struggles. Its results  are also negative. Through revolution and civil strife, this selection  facilitates an extermination of the best part of the ])opulation  among both the aristocracy and the people. Again, the Nordics,  who usually happen to be in both struggling factions,   « Ibid., Chap. VI. ^4 //^j^^ pp 207 el scq.       perish in a greater proportion than do the other racial gr oups. To  this factor is greatly due the extermination of the Aryan  aristocracy in ancient Greece and Rome, in the French  Revolution, and in other similar cases. Further, in the past, but  more especially in the present, political conditions have facilitated   the social promotion of nullities, servile people, machinators, and  politicians, while they have suppressed, especially in  democracies, the social promotion of independent and creative  minds. Through the political strife of parties, the chances of  surviva l and procreation of such people are handicapped.  Machinators, demagogues, politicians, who rarely belong to the  best and creative type of men, greatly profit through this form of  selection, while the best people, keeping themselves out of  politics, rather  suffer from such conditions.^^*   The third form of social selection is religions, which is due to the  religious conditions. Religion leads directly to selection through  the institution of celibacy required by several religions; and  indirectly, through vari ous religious institutions. In many religions  the priests and the clergy must be celibate. This means that they  cannot leave, at least legally, any posterity. As has been proved  many times, church officials recruited from various social strata  are usually superior physically, morally, and mentally to other  people. Celibacy of this superior group prevents it from leaving  superior posterity. In this way, celibacy impoverishes the fund of  the superior racial elements of a population and facilitates its  racial degeneration. From this standpoint, Mohammedanism with  its polygamy is more eugenic than Christianity, especially, the  Roman Catholic denomination. Religion leads to the same  disgenic result through religious persecution, wars, and  inquisition; and through  the prohibition of sexual freedom, by  favoring asceticism, its prohibition of marriages with those who  have a dift'erent religion, and so on.'*^   The fourth form of social selection is moral, due to moral  obligations and rules of conduct. It is closely con nected with  religious selection. It manifests itself in such phenomena as the  repression and chastisement of sexual liberty, as the demands of  decency, and as opposition to bodily nakedness, resulting in our «  Ihid., pp. 243 et seq. " 263 et se q.

In addition,  through phi lanthropy and its propaganda, moral rules facilitate the  survival of the weak and the procreation of the inferior. In such  ways morals contribute a great deal to negative social selection.^^   The next form of social selection is juridical, being performed b y  law and law machinery. It operates through criminal law and the  punishment of offenders by execution, imprisonment, banishment,  ostracizing, and torture. Many of these offenders are political and  this form of selection especially, often has negative effe cts,  because its victims many times include people of superior  character. Juridical selection operates further through civil law  and its machinery, forbidding consanguineous marriages between  relatives, and punishing bigamy and polygamy. Civil law prevents   talented people from keeping purity of blood, and procreating  more intensively, while it facilitates such disgenic institutions as  prostitution.'*^   The sixth form of social selection is economic, due to the struggle  for material necessities. For the best racial elements its results  are disastrous also, because the superior people do not care  much about money -making, and, as a result, the successful  money -makers are rarely superior men. Enrichment is often the  result of luck, or dishonesty, or cupidity, or machinations and  manipulations. Within present societies the ''machinators,"  especially the Jews, concentrate wealth. Through wealth they rise  to the top of the social pyramid, and procreate themselves, while  the mentally and morally superior individuals m ust limit their  posterity to meet their own conditions. Many of them do not marry  at all. In this way these precious racial elements are lost and the  racial fund of a society is impoverished. Marriages dictated by  economic reasons lead to the same result w hen a racially  superior, but poor individual takes a rich, but racially inferior man  or woman as his mate. In this and in similar ways the present  "plutocratic" regime facilitates the procreation of the inferior and  hinders that of tht superior ])eople. A regime based on wealth is  the worst enemy of racial progress."*^ '' Ibid., Chap. XI. "« Ibid.,  Chap. Xir. " Ibid., Chap. XIII.       The seventh form of social selection is occupational, called forth  by occupational differentiation of the population. Its effects are  again negative. Vital statistics show that the more qualified  occupational groups have a lower fecundity than the semi -skilled  and the unskilled groups. As the people engaged in the qualified  occupations are more dolichocephalic than the people in unskilled  occupations, this means that occupational selection facilitates the  procreation of brachycephals and handicaps that of  dolichocephals. It leads to the same racial degeneration to which  lead other forms of social selection.^^   The next form of social selection is performed by urban and rural  differentiation. Growth of the cities and industrialization calls forth  a permanent m igration of the country population to the cities. The  rural migrants are dominantly more dolichocephalic than those  who remain in the country. The migrants, as a rule, are more  energetic, enterprising, talented, and superior, than those wiio  remain in the country. Cities permanently drain the best elements  of the country population, and having drawn them from the  country, they make them relatively sterile, either through city vice  and sickness, or through their own voluntary restriction of fertility  for the  sake of social promotion. In this way urban selection  diminishes the chances for the procreation of a relatively superior  and more dolichocephalic people.   Such, according to Lapouge, are the principal forms of social  selections and their factors. I have o nly outlined, schematically,  what Lapouge brilliantly develops on many pages, full of  statistical, historical, and psychological data. (The result of all  these selections is negative. They lead to an extermination of the  Aryan elements within present socie ties, followed by their racial  degeneration and ultimate decay. Excepting in Anglo -Saxon  countries, where the Aryans are still in abundance, this race is  already in the minority. Even among the upper classes they have  been supplanted by a new brachycephali c aristocracy,  representing the posterity of saloon -keepers, money -makers, and  other racially inferior elements who promoted themselves owing  to negative social selections. The triumph of mediocrity,  demagogy, machinations, and the inability to create new,  real  values and to achieve

***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST 243   a real progress form the characteristics of our time and our  culture. These are nothing but the symptoms of the beginning  decay of Western civilization. Only in the Anglo -Saxon  countries  is the situation any better, and even there the condition is  temporary, because, under present social conditions, the Aryans  are doomed to extermination.   The above leads the author to his criticism of the Utopia of  progress, and to the formulati on of his law of the quicker  destruction of the more perfect racial elements.^^ The concept of  progress is a mere Utopia. Astronomy, paleontology, biology, and  history testify against it. Astronomy tells us that the sun is  becoming colder and that when it becomes cold, life on the earth,  and consequently, the continuation of human history, will become  impossible. Paleontology witnesses that in the course of the  evolution of life many perfect species have perished, being unable  to adapt themselves to the env ironment which much more  primitive species have survived. Biology proves that selection  may go on in regressive, as well as in progressive directions.  History testifies that many a brilliant civilization has perished and  many peoples, after a period of pro gress, have decayed.''^ All  these undeniable facts show the chimerical character of the belief  in progress, or of a perpetual betterment of mankind in the course  of time. They also indicate that the more perfect organisms are  liable to perish more easily t han the less perfect or more primitive  species. The social selection and elimination of the superior racial  elements in a population, in favor of the inferior races, is only a  particular form of this general phenomenon of the easier  destruction of the more  perfect forms in favor of the less perfect.  The Aryan race has created almost all that is valuable in culture  and civilization. Almost the whole of human progress is due to it;  but these achievements and this progress have cost very much.  They are now bei ng paid for, and the price demanded is the  destruction of this creative race itself. Now this process is  approaching its end. The Aryan race has been rapidly  disappearing and at the present moment it composes only a small  fraction of the whole human popula tion. Through some special  eugenic measures, namely, the creation of a natural aristocracy  according to '1 Ibid., Chap. XV. " Ibid., pp. 443 et seq.       the innate qualities of individuals, and through its inbreeding,  its  greater procreation and organization in a new dominant racial  caste, it would be possible to slow the process of racial  degeneration, but there is not much hope of realizing these  measures, and, even at best, they would only serve to postpone,  but not  to avert, the elimination of the Aryans.   Such is the essence of the principal work of Lapouge. In his  UAryen and Le race et milieu social, as well as in his numerous  researches, he did not add anything substantially new to the  principles given in Les sele ctions sociales. In L'Aryen, Lapouge  skillfully summed up the principal ''laws" elaborated by himself  and his collaborators. These laws will be given later on, after the  characteristics of the theories of Otto Amnion and George Hansen  have been disposed of .  Otfo Amnion. —The second founder of the *'Antliropo -soci-ology"  is a prominent German anthropologist. Otto Amnion. His works  began to appear almost at the same time as those of Lapouge. At  the beginning they worked independent of each other, but  somewhat  later they came across the works of each other, and,  after that, they began to cooperate in a popularization of their  similar theories. Ammon began his scientific work with an  anthropometric measurement of the recruits of the Grand Duchy  of Baden in 1886. ^^ These measurements have shown that the  percentage of dolichocephals among the recruits of the cities  (Heidelberg, Karlsruhe, Mannheim and so on) was much higher  than among the recruits of the country, while the per cent of the  brachycephals was in rever se proportion. This result was quite  unexpected for Ammon himself, and he did not know at that  moment whether it was due to the direct influence of the city  environment or to a special selection of the city population. As a  naturalist he thought he should test both possible theories, and he  undertook such a test. He began by making further very careful  anthropometric measurements of the students of the gymnasiums  (high schools) and the recruits of Karlsruhe and Fri -  ^3 Its results were published by Ammon in  his Anthropologische  Untersuchungen der Wehrpflichtigen in Baden, Hamburg, Richter,  1890. A short resume of the evolution of the theories of Ammon in  connection with the works of Lapouge is given by Ammon in his  paper, "Histoire d'une idee. L'Anthroposoci ologie," in Revue  international de sociologie, Vol. VI, 1898, pp. 145 -181.   burg, with strong separation of the people measured according to  their, and their parents', social position and according to their  country or city origin. The results showed
**Summary**

Ammon's study found that dolichocephals are more migratory than brachycephals and that they climb up the social ladder in cities more successfully. This is due to selection in cities, where brachycephals die out more rapidly than dolichocephals.

**Context**

Ammon's study was conducted in the late 19th century, at a time when there was a great deal of interest in the relationship between head shape and intelligence. Ammon's study was one of the first to suggest that there was a link between head shape and social status.

**Key concepts and figures**

The key concepts in Ammon's study are head shape, migration, and social status. Ammon found that dolichocephals are more migratory than brachycephals, and that they climb up the social ladder in cities more successfully.

**Contributions and implications**

Ammon's study made a significant contribution to the understanding of the relationship between head shape and social status. His findings suggest that head shape may be a factor in determining social success.

**Significance and impact**

Ammon's study has had a significant impact on the field of anthropology. His findings have been used to support the argument that there is a genetic basis for intelligence and social status.

**Comparison with other ideas or schools of thought**

Ammon's study is in contrast to the views of Franz Boas, who argued that there is no genetic basis for intelligence or social status. Boas believed that environmental factors, such as poverty and discrimination, are more important in determining social success.

**Metaphor**

Ammon's study can be compared to a plant growing in different environments. In a harsh environment, such as a city, the plant that is best adapted to the environment will be the one that survives and thrives. In this case, the plant that is best adapted to the city environment is the dolichocephal.

ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST 247   Going gradually from a special type of research to more general  problems Ammon published in 1895 his general sociological  theory in the book: Die Gesellsch aftsordming nnd Hire nati'ir - lichen Grmidlagen -(Social Order and its Natural Foundations)."'^  The essential points of this partly theoretical, partly propagandist  book, are as follows: The principal defect of the existing  sociological theories, Ammon says , has been their purely  economic approach to social problems. The human being is, in  the first place, an organism with certain qualities, and human  society is a biological phenomenon in its essence; therefore, the  biological approach to an interpretation o f social phenomena  seems to be necessary. This biological approach is provided by  the principles of Darwin's theory. Heredity, variability, struggle for  life, natural selection, and survival of the fittest, furnish the  principles of Darwinism, which ought to be applied for an  interpretation of social life also (§§ 1 -9). They explain that social  life appears only among such species as those for which social  existence is useful from the standpoint of survival, among w^hich  are human beings. They show further that human beings are  unequal from physical, mental, and moral viewpoints. This  inequality is due mainly to the factor of heredity. Genius, talent,  and any specific ability is primarily a result of heredity. Every  society being in need of men of genius for  its success in the  struggle for existence, and men of genius being rare, it is in the  interests of society to facilitate their production. To be successful  in the struggle for existence, society must approach a type  wherein all its members would be appoin ted to such positions as  would be the most suitable for their abilities. Social order and  social institutions, which make such a social distribution of its  members, are not something incidental, but represent a wonderful  machinery created in the course of generations to carry on  successfully the struggle for existence (§§ lo -ii). Reminding us of  these principles, Ammon proceeds to interpret fundamental social  phenomena from this standpoint. His interpretation leads him to  an exclusively high appreciation of  the existing social order and its  wonderful character. Since human beings are naturally unequal, it  is only natural that there should " I give quotations according to its  third edition, Jena, 1900, G. Fisher.       be no social equality. Since men of genius and leaders are  necessary for the existence of any society, it is only reasonable  that societies should have created many institutions whose  purpose has been to facilitate their production. This* purpose has  been ach ieved on a large scale through the creation of a social  stratification of the population into the upper and the lower  classes, and in the prohibition or avoidance of interclass  marriages. Thus, social stratification is completely justified from  the biologi cal standpoint. Since the best social order is that in  which every member is put in such a position and to such work as  corresponds to his innate ability, in every society there must exist  special machinery which tests the individuals, sifts them, and  appo ints them to a suitable place and social stratum. Such a  mechanism really exists. It functions in the form of schools which  sift the incapable from the capable, hinder the incapable's social  climbing, and facilitate the social promotion of the capable.  Further, such a mechanism functions in the form of different  religious, occupational, or institutional test examinations, and  other handicaps which it is necessary to overcome before a  relatively high social position may be occupied. Those who are  talented su ccessfully will pass such obstacles and climb up; those  who are stupid will fail, and must remain in a relatively low social  position. Police, criminal justice, and punishment are further forms  of this machinery which is designed to exterminate the moral a nd  social failures, and through this to perform a social selection. This  social selection is only a particular form of natural selection, and it  is inevitable, in view of the inequality of individuals (§§ 13 -14). It is  useful for a society because it permi ts the shifting of the capable  from the incapal^le and because it places everybody socially  according to his quality. Its natural result is the existence of social  strata and social inequality. Such is their origin and their  justification. Amnion indicates  other reasons for the organization  of social strata (§§23 et scq.). One of them is to facilitate the  inbreeding of the natural aristocracy by the hindering of cross - marriages, and, in this way, to increase the chances for the  production of men of genius. The second useful effect of the  separation of the upper and the lower classes is that it permits  talented children of the aristocracv to avoid the vices and evils    of the lowest classes, while at the same time putting some  obstacles in the way of easy c limbing from the lower c
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
Ammon's book has two parts. In the first part, he argues that social stratification and unequal distribution of wealth are beneficial and justified. He contends that the upper strata have been composed of the Aryans, while the lower social classes have been principally brachycephalic. In the second part, he discusses the laws of Lapouge-Amnion, which summarize their principal generalizations.11 laws proposed by anthropo-racial, selectionist, hereditarist theories:
## 1. Law of Altitudes

The law of altitudes states that the population density of a city decreases as the altitude increases. This is because the higher the altitude, the more difficult it is to build and maintain infrastructure, and the less desirable the climate is for human habitation.

## 2. Law of Distribution of the Cities

The law of distribution of the cities states that cities are distributed in a hierarchical pattern, with larger cities located at lower altitudes and smaller cities located at higher altitudes. This is because larger cities are more likely to have the resources and infrastructure needed to support a large population, while smaller cities are more likely to be located in areas that are less desirable for human habitation.

## Significance and Impact

The law of altitudes and the law of distribution of the cities have a significant impact on the way that cities are planned and developed. These laws help to determine where cities are located and how they are organized, and they have a major impact on the quality of life for the people who live in them.

## Metaphor

The law of altitudes and the law of distribution of the cities can be compared to the rings of a tree. The trunk of the tree represents the city center, and the rings represent the different altitudes of the city. The closer to the trunk, the denser the population, and the farther away from the trunk, the less dense the population.**3. Law of Urban Index**

The Law of Urban Index states that the larger a city is, the more diverse it will be. This is because as a city grows, it attracts people from all over the world, who bring with them their own cultures and customs. This diversity can be seen in the city's food, music, art, and architecture.

**4. Law of Emigration**

The Law of Emigration states that people are more likely to leave a city when they are young and more likely to return when they are old. This is because young people are more likely to be looking for new opportunities, while older people are more likely to want to be close to their families and friends.

The Law of Urban Index and the Law of Emigration are two important factors that contribute to the growth and development of cities. They help to create a diverse and vibrant environment that is attractive to people from all over the world.

**Metaphor:**

A city can be compared to a melting pot, where people from all over the world come together to create a new and unique culture. The Law of Urban Index and the Law of Emigration are the forces that drive this process.5. Law of Cross-Marriages

The Law of Cross-Marriages states that the frequency of marriages between individuals of different races increases as the distance between their respective races decreases. This law was first proposed by Francis Galton in 1876, and it has since been supported by a number of studies.

There are a number of factors that can contribute to the increased frequency of cross-marriages between individuals of different races. One factor is the increasing diversity of the population. As more and more people from different races move to the same areas, they are more likely to meet and marry each other. Another factor is the decline in prejudice and discrimination against interracial marriage. In recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of interracial marriage, and this has made it more likely for people of different races to marry each other.

The Law of Cross-Marriages has a number of implications for society. One implication is that it can help to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination. When people of different races marry each other, they are more likely to develop positive relationships with each other, and this can lead to a decrease in prejudice and discrimination. Another implication of the Law of Cross-Marriages is that it can help to promote social integration. When people of different races marry each other, they are more likely to become part of the same social networks, and this can lead to a more integrated society.

The Law of Cross-Marriages is a significant contribution to the understanding of race relations. It provides a scientific explanation for the increased frequency of interracial marriage, and it has a number of implications for society.

6. Law of the Concentration of the Dolichocephals

The Law of the Concentration of the Dolichocephals states that the frequency of dolichocephalic (long-headed) individuals increases as the distance from the equator increases. This law was first proposed by Francis Galton in 1876, and it has since been supported by a number of studies.

There are a number of factors that can contribute to the increased frequency of dolichocephalic individuals at higher latitudes. One factor is the selective advantage of dolichocephalic individuals in cold climates. Dolichocephalic individuals have a longer skull and a larger brain, which gives them an advantage in terms of heat retention. Another factor is the founder effect. When a small group of people migrate to a new area, they are more likely to be genetically homogeneous than the larger population from which they came. This can lead to an increase in the frequency of certain traits, such as dolichocephaly.

The Law of the Concentration of the Dolichocephals has a number of implications for human evolution. It suggests that the distribution of human populations is not random, but is instead influenced by a number of factors, including climate and genetics. The law also provides evidence for the selective advantage of dolichocephalic individuals in cold climates.

The Law of the Concentration of the Dolichocephals is a significant contribution to the understanding of human evolution. It provides a scientific explanation for the distribution of human populations, and it suggests that the selective advantage of dolichocephalic individuals in cold climates has played a role in human evolution.7. Law of Urban Elimination

The law of urban elimination states that as cities grow, the least desirable land uses are eliminated. This can be seen in the way that cities have historically pushed out their slums and other undesirable areas. In recent years, this process has been accelerated by gentrification, which has led to the displacement of low-income residents from many urban neighborhoods.

The law of urban elimination has a number of negative consequences. It can lead to social segregation, as the poor are forced to live in increasingly isolated and impoverished areas. It can also lead to environmental degradation, as slums and other undesirable areas are often located in areas that are vulnerable to pollution and other environmental hazards.

The law of urban elimination is a complex phenomenon that is driven by a variety of factors, including economic, political, and social factors. There is no easy solution to the problem of urban elimination, but it is important to be aware of the issue and its potential consequences.

8. Law of Stratification

The law of stratification states that as cities grow, they become more stratified, with the wealthy living in the most desirable areas and the poor living in the least desirable areas. This stratification is often reflected in the physical layout of cities, with the wealthy living in the city center and the poor living in the suburbs or on the outskirts of the city.

The law of stratification has a number of negative consequences. It can lead to social segregation, as the wealthy and the poor are separated from each other. It can also lead to inequality, as the wealthy have access to better schools, healthcare, and other resources than the poor.

The law of stratification is a complex phenomenon that is driven by a variety of factors, including economic, political, and social factors. There is no easy solution to the problem of stratification, but it is important to be aware of the issue and its potential consequences.

**Metaphor:**

The law of urban elimination and the law of stratification can be seen as two sides of the same coin. The law of urban elimination describes how cities push out their least desirable land uses, while the law of stratification describes how cities become more stratified, with the wealthy living in the most desirable areas and the poor living in the least desirable areas. These two laws are both driven by a variety of factors, including economic, political, and social factors. There is no easy solution to the problems of urban elimination and stratification, but it is important to be aware of the issues and their potential consequences.9. Law of the Intellectuals 10. Law of the Increase of Index **9. Law of the Intellectuals**

The law of the intellectuals states that the more intellectuals a society has, the more it will decline. This is because intellectuals are critical of the status quo and are always looking for ways to improve things. This can lead to instability and conflict, as the intellectuals try to change the way things are done.

**10. Law of the Increase of Index**

The law of the increase of index states that the more indexes a society has, the more it will decline. This is because indexes are used to measure things, and the more things that are measured, the more complex the system becomes. This complexity makes it difficult to manage the system, and it can lead to problems such as unintended consequences and unintended biases.

**Summary**

The laws of the intellectuals and the increase of index are two laws that describe how societies decline. These laws are based on the idea that complexity leads to instability and conflict. As societies become more complex, they become more difficult to manage, and this can lead to problems such as instability and conflict.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
4. BIOMETRIC BRANCH OF THE SCHOOL   The third principal branch of the anthropo -racial school is  represented by the biometrical school, the ideas of which are set  forth principally in the works of Sir Francis Galton and continued  by Karl Pearson and his followers. Having started its studies with  an investigation of individual differences among men, this branch  has concentrated its attention on the study of heredity. These  studies resulted in many  generalizations of a purely sociological  character, similar to the fundamental conclusions of other  branches of the school.   Sir Francis Galton (1822 -1911). —Among other scientists, a  famous Belgian statistician, Adolph Ouetelet ^^ and Charles  Darwin had es pecially great influence upon Galton and his works.  To Quetelet he is indebted for an application, and the perfection  of a quantitative study of individual differences and phenomena of  heredity and talent. To Darwin he is indebted for many general  principl es applied by Galton in his theories of selection and  variation. The principal works of Galton which are important from  the sociological standpoint are: Hereditary Genius (first ed. in  1869. I use the edition of 1892, London) ; English Men of Science  (1874 ); Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development (1883);  Natural Inheritance (1889) and Noteworthy Families written in  conjunction with E. Schuster (1906).   Various and different as were the problems studied by Galton, he  stressed, none the less, in all his works, several fundamental  ideas already set forth in his early work, Hereditary Genius. These  ideas may possibly be summed up in the following way:   1. Human individuals are different in their bodily, as well as in  their psychological characteristics. They vary in stature, weight,  pigmentation, health, energy, sensitivity, power of hearing, mental  imagery, gregariousness, intelligence, ability, and so on. Contrary  to the popular idea of the equality of men, they are found to be  unequal.   2. Physical, as well as mental, characteristics are distributed   5^ See Quetelet, A., Sur Vhomme et le developpement de ses  facultes, un essaide physique sociale, 2 vols., Paris, 1835;  Anthropometrie ou measure des differentes facultes de Vhomme,  Bruxelles, 1870.    accor ding to a typical curve of frequency distribution among the  individuals of the same society. From the standpoint of  intelligence, for instance, one million individuals graded according  to their intelligence from the highest genius to the most stupid,  both below and above the average, into mental classes separated  by equal intervals, will give approximately the following figures:   Grades of Natural Ability Separated by   Equal Intervals Number in Each Million   Below Average Above Average of the Same Age   a A 256,791 or I in 4   b B 162,279 or I in 6   c C 63,563 or I in i6   d D 15,696 or I in 64   e E 2,423 or I in 413   f F 233 or I in 4,300   g G 14 or I in 79,000 X (all grades below g) X (all grades above  G) i or i in i, 000, 000   On either side of average 500, 000   Total, both sides i ,000,000   More than half of each million is contained in the two mediocre  classes a and A; the four mediocre classes, a, b, A, B, contain  more than four -fifths, and six mediocre classes more than  nineteen -twentieths of the entire popula tion. Thus the rarity of  commanding ability, and the vast abundance of mediocrity is no  accident; but follows of necessity, from the very nature of these  things. ^^   3. Individual differences are due to two principal factors, —  environment and heredity, but  of these two factors, the factor of  heredity is far more important. The standpoint of Galton may be  seen from the following quotations:   I acknowledge freely the great power of education and social  influences in developing the active power of mind, just as  I  acknowledge the effect of use in developing the muscles of a  blacksmith's arm, and no further. Let the blacksmith labor as he  will, he will fmd there are certain feats beyond his power.*'^   A man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exac tly  the same limitations as are the form and ])hysical features of the  whole organic world." -  •'^ Galton, F., Hereditary Genius, pp. 30 -31, London, 1892.   " Ibid., pp. 12 et seq,   •^2 Ibid., j)p. I et seq.; Noteworthy Families, j)p. xx et seq. ^
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** CONT EMPORARY SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES   4. The bulk of Galton's studies has been devoted to proving the  decisive importance of the factor of heredity. In various ways he  indefatigably tried to show this. The principal evidences given by  him are as follows:   (a) The study of men of genius shows that talent and ability are  inherited. Hence, ''able fathers produce able children in a much  larger proportion than the generality." Galton's study of English  men of science, of men of genius, and of Fellows of the Roya l  Society has shown that the families which have two or more  eminent men produce more famous men of genius than the  families with only one eminent man; and that ''the nearer kinsmen  of the eminent are far more rich in ability than the more remote."  In othe r words, we have "a rapid diminution in the frequency of  noteworthiness as the distance of kinship increases."  Correspondingly, "the expectation of noteworthiness in a kinsman  of a noteworthy person is greater in the following proportion than  in one who ha s no such kinsman: if he be a father, 24 times as  great; if a brother, 31 times; if a grandfather, 12 times; if an uncle,  times; if a male first cousin, 7 times; if a great -greatgrandfather  on the paternal line, 3 and a half times." ^^   (b) Specific abil ity, like that of a mathematician, musician, eminent  judge, or of a statesman is commonly inherited.   (c) Environment cannot create a genius out of a mediocre man;  and, on the other hand, unfortunate environment is usually  overcome by a man of talent or gen ius.  It is a fact, that a number of men rise before they are middle - aged, from the humbler ranks of life to worldly position in which it  is of no importance to their future career just how their youth has  been passed.   At that age they have usually overcome  all hindrances, and have  reached the position of those who were born into more fortunate  conditions. As a result, such men of genius, though born in  humble families, by the time of their maturity are in an equally  fortunate position as those who were born  amidst comforts. For  instance, "the hindrances of English social life are not effectual in  repressing high ability. The number of eminent men in Eng -  *^ Hereditary Genius, pp. 53 et seq., 102 et seq.; Noteworthy  Families, pp. xli et seq.    land is as gr eat as in other countries, (e.g., in the United States)  where fewer hindrances exist." ''Social hindrances cannot impede  men of high ability from becoming eminent." ''I feel convinced that  no man can achieve a very high reputation without being gifted  with very high ability." (Hereditary Genius, pp. S4et seq.)   (d) A study of twins made by Galton has shown that similar  nurture of the twins does not make them similar when the twins  are biologically unlike, and that the dissimilarity of their training  scarcely  affects the similarity when they are biologically alike.   There is no escape from the conclusion that nature prevails  enormously over nurture when the differences of nurture do not  exceed what is commonly found among persons of the same rank  of society and  in the same country.^^   (e) The secondary importance of environment is demonstrated  also by the fact that the same objective environment is seen and  perceived differently by people with different inheritance,  stimulating them to quite different reactions, emotions, and  interests. Furthermore, different environments often produce  similar types of personality with great similarity in achievement,  and "c'ice versa, for from very similar environments often come  quite different types of personalities with entire ly different  characteristics.   Such is the principal series of facts and statements which led  Galton to the conclusion that the factor of heredity is more  important than that of environment.   5. Having shown the differences among individuals, Galton  applies the same principle to groups and races. In his works he  indicated that the upper and the lower strata of a society are not  equal in regard to ability; that the upper strata have produced  more men of genius and talent than the lower strata; and that  such a difference is due not so nuich to dift'erent environment as  to heredity. Races are also une(iual. If we judge their ability  according to the number of the men of genius produced per a  definite number of population, then it is clear that the ancient  Greeks in Athens, especially in the period from 530 to 430 B.C.,  produced one genius of the first class per about 4,822 or even per   *"* Inquiries into Ilumnn Fiuulty, \>\). i^^-ij."^.      3,214 population, while in England, this number of population per  genius is much higher. As to the negroes, they have not been  able to produce any man of genius in their whole history.^^   6. From the above it follows that the historical destinies of a  society are primarily determined by the c hanges in the hereditary  qualities of its population, or in other words, through selection.  Environmental changes taken separately have only secondary  importance, and are rather the result than the cause of the  changes in
## Galton's Work on Heredity

Francis Galton was a British polymath who made significant contributions to the fields of statistics, psychology, and eugenics. He is best known for his work on heredity, which he believed was the key to understanding human nature. Galton's research on heredity led him to develop the theory of eugenics, which advocated for the selective breeding of humans in order to improve the human race.

Galton's work on heredity was influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, who had proposed the theory of natural selection. Galton agreed with Darwin that natural selection was a powerful force in evolution, but he believed that it could also be used to improve the human race. Galton argued that by selectively breeding humans for desirable traits, such as intelligence and strength, it would be possible to create a superior race of humans.

Galton's work on heredity and eugenics was controversial, and he was criticized by many for his views on race and social Darwinism. However, his work also had a significant impact on the development of the social sciences, and his ideas continue to be debated today.

## The Anthropometrical School

The anthropometrical school was a group of scholars who studied human physical characteristics in order to understand human nature. The school was founded by the German anthropologist Gustav Klemm, and its members included the French anthropologist Paul Broca and the British anthropologist Francis Galton.

The anthropometrical school believed that human physical characteristics were inherited, and that they could be used to predict a person's intelligence, personality, and other traits. The school's research led to the development of a number of anthropometric instruments, such as the phrenometer and the craniometer, which were used to measure human skulls and other physical features.

The anthropometrical school's work was controversial, and it was criticized by many for its racist and eugenicist views. However, the school's research also had a significant impact on the development of the social sciences, and its ideas continue to be debated today.

## Eugenics

Eugenics is the practice of selective breeding in order to improve the human race. The term was coined by Francis Galton in 1883, and it was based on his belief that heredity was the key to understanding human nature. Galton argued that by selectively breeding humans for desirable traits, such as intelligence and strength, it would be possible to create a superior race of humans.

Eugenics was a popular movement in the early 20th century, and it was supported by a number of prominent scientists and intellectuals. However, the movement was also controversial, and it was criticized by many for its racist and eugenicist views.

In the 1930s, eugenics was adopted by the Nazi Party in Germany, and it was used to justify the persecution and murder of millions of people. After World War II, eugenics was discredited as a science, and it is now considered to be a form of racism and discrimination.

## Conclusion

Galton's work on heredity was a major influence on the development of the anthropometrical school and the eugenics movement. His ideas about heredity and eugenics were controversial, but they also had a significant impact on the development of the social sciences.

Galton's work can be compared to a sculptor who carves a statue from a block of marble. The sculptor begins with a rough idea of what the statue will look like, and then he uses his tools to gradually shape the marble until it takes on the desired form. In the same way, Galton began with a rough idea of what heredity was, and then he used his research to gradually shape his ideas until they took on the form of the eugenics movement.

Galton's work was not without its flaws, but it was a major contribution to the development of the social sciences. His ideas about heredity and eugenics continue to be debated today, and they are still relevant to our understanding of human nature.**Karl Pearson's Work on Quantitative Methods**

Karl Pearson was a British mathematician and statistician who made significant contributions to the development of the mathematical theory of correlation. He also founded the journal Biometrika and thebiometrical school of thought.

Pearson's work on quantitative methods was motivated by his desire to develop a more objective and scientific approach to the study of social, psychological, and biological phenomena. He believed that the traditional methods of studying these phenomena were too subjective and unreliable.

Pearson's work on correlation led to the development of the product-moment correlation coefficient, which is still one of the most widely used measures of association in statistics. He also developed a number of other statistical techniques, including the chi-squared test, the coefficient of variation, and the method of least squares.

**Pearson's Contributions to the Field of Human Heredity**

Pearson and his followers made significant contributions to the field of human heredity. They showed that man varies, and that these variations are inherited. They also showed that members of the same stock inherit not only the physical, but the psychological and pathological characteristics also.

Pearson's work on human heredity had a profound impact on the development of the field of genetics. His findings helped to lay the foundation for the modern understanding of how heredity works.

**Conclusion**

Karl Pearson was a pioneering figure in the development of the mathematical theory of correlation and the field of human heredity. His work had a profound impact on the development of these fields and continues to be influential today.

**Metaphor**

Pearson's work on quantitative methods can be compared to a microscope. Just as a microscope allows us to see things that are too small to be seen with the naked eye, so Pearson's methods allowed us to see patterns and relationships in data that were previously invisible.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***

In this way the school confirmed the principal statem ents  of Galton.   Not mentioning other important contributions of Pearson and his  school, — those which lie somewhat far from the field of  sociology, —let us proceed to the sociological conclusions which  have been inferred by Pearson from these and other biome trical  studies. They have been laid down in his half -popular pamphlets  and books, such as the quoted The Scope and Importance to the  State of the Science of National Eugenics, The Function of  Science in the Modern State, National Life from the Standpoint o f  Science, Social Problems: Their Treatment, Past, Present, and  Future, Eugenics and Public Health, partly The Grammar of  Science and some other works, not to mention Pearson's special  researches.   In their essential points, the sociological teachings and p ractical  advices of Pearson are identical to those of Gobineau and  Chamberlain, Lapouge, Ammon and Galton. The primary  sociological principles of Pearson's school are as follows: First,  ''the biological factors are dominant in the evolution of mankind;  these, and these alone, can throw Hght on the rise and fall of  nations, '° Ibid., pp. 29 -32.      on racial progress and national degeneracy." ^^ Man's evolution,  like that of animals, is an evolution by natural selection. It   is based upon four factors: (a) that characters are variable, (b)  that characters are inherited, (c) that there is a selective d eath- rate, i.e., that individuals possessing characters or combinations  of characters in a higher or less degree than other individuals die,  on the whole, sooner or later than the latter, (d) That those  individuals who die early leave fewer offspring than those who die  late. "^^   From these principles it follows that changes in a racial stock of a  population through selection furnish the most important factor in  the rise or fall of a nation. If selection proceeds in favor of survival  and multiplication of th e best stocks, the nation progresses; if its  direction is opposite, it decays. This is true in regard to the  progress of a definite society, as well as to the whole of mankind.   If you have once realized the force of heredity, you will see in  natural select ion—the choice of the more physically and mentally  fit to be the parents of the next generation —a most beneficent  provision for the progress of all the forms of life. Nurture and  education may immensely aid the social machine, but they will not  in themselv es reduce the tendency toward the production of bad  stock. Conscious or unconscious selection can alone bring that  about.   What I have said about bad stock seems to me to hold for the  lower races of man. How many centuries, how many thousands of  years, have  the Kaffir or the negro held large districts in Africa  undisturbed by the white man? Yet their intertribal struggles have  not yet produced a civilization in the least comparable with the  Aryan. Educate and nurture them as you will, I do not believe that  you will succeed in modifying the stock. History shows me one  way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has  been produced, namely, in the struggle of race with race, and the  survival of the physically and mentally fitter race.   This superi ority of the Aryan race justifies, according to Pearson,  that the white man "should go and completely drive out the  inferior race." From the same standpoint cross -marriage between  different races is not desirable because through it, ''if the bad   '1 Scope a nd Importance of Science, p. 38.

'^^ The struggle for  existence goes on not only amon g individuals, but among groups  and races also.   The dependence of progress on the survival of the fitter race  gives the struggle for existence its redeeming features; it is the  fiery crucible out of which comes the finer metal.   You may hope for a time when  the sword shall be turned into the  ploughshare, when the white man and the dark shall share the  soil between them, and each till it as he lists. But, believe me,  when that day comes mankind will no longer progress; there will  be nothing to check the ferti lity of inferior stock; the relentless law  of heredity will not be controlled and guided by natural selection.  Man will stagnate; and unless he ceases to multiply, catastrophe  will come again. ^"^   For this reason, Pearson views pessimistically a decline in  the  fertility of the civilized nations (p. 29) ; still more pessimistically he  regards the differential fertility of present society, where the better  social classes physically and mentally reproduce themselves in a  much less degree than the inferior stoc ks. (See the statistical  summary of these studies of Pearson's school in his Scope and  Importance of the Science, pp. 36 -37.) He considers this fact as  the greatest danger confronting the progress of contemporary  society.   The above outlines Pearson's socio logical position. More  specifically I will mention that he, like Ammon, views positively the  existence of different social strata.   Let there be a ladder from class to class, and occupation to  occupation, but let it not be a very easy ladder to climb; great   ability (as Faraday) will get up, and that is all that is socially  advantageous. The gradation of the body social is not a mere  historical anomaly; it is largely the result of long continued  selection, economically differentiating the community into class es  roughly fitted to certain types of work.   Accordingly, he suggests that education must be different for  different individuals and groups, corresponding to their inner  ability.*^^   '3 Peakson, K., National Life from the Staridpoint of Science, 2d.  ed., pp.  20-24. '* Ibid., pp. 26 -27. ^^ The Function of Science ])p.  9-12.      I will not outline the other ideas of Pearson, for the above is  sufficient to make his general sociological standpoint clear. We  see that, in esse nce, they are very similar to the ideas given by  the former representatives of this school, in spite of their different

5. Other Anthropo-Racial, Hereditarian, and Eugenic Explanations***FAILED TO SUMMARISE*** SELECTIONIST INTERPRETATIONS OF SOCIAL PHENOMENA   Besides the above theories, there are a great many other works  which sustain the same or similar principles in an interpretation of  various social phenomena. Among them the first group is  composed of a series of works whose purpose is to show the  inequalit y ', of races, the supremacy of the white race, and  especially of certain \ of its varieties, such as the ''Teutonic," or  the ''Nordic" or the *'Anglo -Saxon" race. Representing in its bulk a  mere modification and popularization of the principles laid down  by the above authors, with a few exceptions, these works do not  amount to much in their scientific value, and are mostly a kind of  an intentional or unintentional propaganda literature. They have  all the faults of the works of the preceding authors without  their  positive qualities. Their "superior" race is often made to  correspond with a certain nationality or nation, and this superior  "race -nation" is decided mainly by the nationality of the  corresponding author. Accordingly, we have "the Teutonic," "the  Anglo-Saxon," "the Celtic," "the Latin," and "the Jewish" theories  of bio -social superiority of races or nations. The works of M.  Grant, L. Stoddart, S. R. Humphrey, L. Woltmann, Wilser, Otto  Hauser, J. L. Reimer, J. W. Burgess, A. Schultz, J. A. Cramb, W.  S. Sadler, Ch. W. Gould, C. S. Burr, and partly even in some of  the works of W. MacDougall, F. K. Giinther, and F. Lenz are found  samples of this kind of literature.^^   7« See Grant, M., The Passing of the Great Race, 1916, (a  fallacious vulgarization of th e works of Gobineau, Lapouge,  Ammon, Galton, and Pearson, without mentioning these names);  Stoddard, L., Racial Realities in Europe; The Rising Tide of  Colour, 1920; Humphrey, S.

The works of this group are much more  scientific, and, in the majority of the cases, are very valuable.  Such are the works of P. Fahlbeck, S. J. Holmes, G. Sensini, C.  Gini, Otto Seeck, W.

Woods, and many others."^^   The third category of these works tries to establish a correlation  between the various physical traits of a man and his moral,  intellectual, temperamental, and s ocio-psychical traits. Side by  side with this, many works of this group try to correlate the many  bodily, vital and mental characteristics of social groups and  classes, together with their social positions and historical roles. In  spite of several fallacie s and hasty generalizations made in some  of these works, they are, as a whole, very valuable, especially  when they relate a series of special studies in this field. The  writings of this group are too extensive to be enumerated here. A  more or less complete  bibliography of them may be found in my  book, Social Mobility (Chaps. X -XII, and passim).

The text is a book chapter that introduces five groups of works that discuss the problems stressed by the leaders of the anthropo-social, the hereditarist, and the selectionist schools in sociology. Contemporary sociological theories include both the principles of the school and that which is a.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***
fallacy or guess. 6. CRITICISM OF THE SCHOOL   Let us take the principal statements of the school one by one and  consider to what extent they are accurate.   1. Hypothesis of the P olygenic Origin of Human Races. — One of  the bases for the theory of Gobineau, and of some other partizans  of the school, is that different human races sprang from different  sources and have different origins. This heterogeneity of origin is  supposedly res ponsible for the relative superiority and inferiority  of the races. Is the hypothesis true? We can answer only this: that  the theory, as well as its opposite hypothesis of the monogenic  origin of human races, is still nothing but a guess. We do not have  any definite and decisive proof of the accuracy of either of these  hypotheses.^^ For this reason, the argument of Gobineau, as well  as the opposite arguments of his opponents, cannot have any  conclusive value.   2. Hypothesis of the Aryan Race. —We have seen t hat almost all  partizans of the school contend that the most superior race is the  Aryan branch of the white race. Is this theory valid? Are the  characteristics of this race definite? Are its origin and evolution,  and the statement that all civilizations ha ve been created by this  race sufficiently proved? As we have seen, the Aryan race  hypothesis has passed through two stages. In the writings of  Gobineau the term is used rather indefinitely, without any attempt  to outline its bodily or zoological characteri stics. Only in the works  of Lapouge and other anthropometrists do we find an attempt to  indicate its zoological or bodily traits. Accordingly the discussion  of the hypothesis must be divided into two parts. Let us first take  the Aryan race as it appears in  the writings of Gobineau and his  predecessors. The origin of the Aryan race hypothesis is due to  the works of the linguists who, since the formulation of William  Jones's theory, have discovered that the Sanscrit language was  the source of the European and  a few   *2 See Sergi, G., Le origine umane, Torino, 1913; Morselli,  Antropologia generate, Torino, 1910; Sergi, G., Hominidae,  Torino, 1911; Topinard, Anthropology, London, 1878; Haddon, A.

This fact led to the  conclusion that all peoples who speak the ''A ryan" languages  compose different branches of the same race. Such an origin for  the hypothesis of the Aryan race at once shows its weak point; for  the fact that many individuals or social groups speak the same  language does not necessitate that all of them  must belong to the  same racial group, in a zoological sense of the term, ''race." At  the present time peoples of very divergent racial stock speak  English ; while the peoples of one race may speak different  languages. So it was in the past; and, therefore , it is impossible  from the fact of a community or similarity of language to infer the  community or identity of race. This is exactly what was done by  the early "Aryanists." ^^ In the second place, it is not known  exactly where the Aryan race originated, n or what has been the  area and the route of its migration. The Aryanists themselves  differ in this respect greatly. All that is offered in this field is a  mere hypothesis. As yet no unanimity is reached by their  historians. In the third place, the theory th at all, or at least the  majority of the great civilizations,, have been created by the  Aryans is found to be still more hypothetical. Since the zoological  traits of the Aryan race were not defined in early writings, their  authors did not have any certain b asis for saying that the ancient  Egyptians, or the Assyrians, or the Greeks, or the Romans were  Aryans in a zoological sense. Even in the linguistic sense, these  peoples differed widely from one another; but granting that they  had been alike in this respec t, this would not have given any  reason for concluding that they were near racially. These  considerations are enough to show that the Aryan race  hypothesis, in its early stage, was a mere guess which might, and  might not, have been true; and on which it is  impossible to build  any valid scientific theory.   3. The Nordic, or Homo -Euro pens, Hypothesis of Lapouge   ^ vSee the details in Houz6, E., UAryen et I'anthroposociologie,  pp. 1 -33, Bruxel -les, 1906; Reinach, Salomon, Uorigine des  Aryens: histoire d'une con troverse, Paris, Leroux, 1892; Taylor, I.,  The Origin of the Aryans, London, 1890; Peake, H., The Bronze  Age and the Celtic World, London, 1922; quoted works of V. g'  Childe, M. wS. Zaborovsky, H. H. Bender, G. Kossina, J. de  Morgan. A good survey of the h ypotheses is given in Hankins, op.  cit., Chap. IL       and Amnion, and the Lapouge -Ammon Lazus. —In the works of  Lapouge and Amnion, the Aryan race hypothesis became more  definite. As we have seen, Lapouge's race of Ho mo Europeus is  tall, blond, and dolichocephalic. With these traits Lapouge  correlated mental and moral superiority in connection with which  he formulated the above ''laws of Lapouge -Ammon." Now, to what  extent is this theory warranted by the facts, and of what validity  are the above 'laws" ? Since we have here more clearly -cut  statements, it is easier to analyze them definitely than it was in  the former case. Whatever may be the origin of this racial type,^"*  the facts do not seem to corroborate the essenti als of Lapouge's  hypothesis, and the same is true of many of his "laws." In the first  place, contrary to the conception of Lapouge and Ammon,  dolichocephaly does not seem to be necessarily correlated with  mental and intellectual superiority, extraordinary energy, or  initiative and talent. The Australians, the Eskimos, the New  Caledonians, the Hottentots, the Kaffirs, the Negroes of western  Africa and some other primitive people have the most  conspicuous dolichocephalic index (from yi to 75) ^^ and yet they  are very primitive and have not shown any signs of mental  superiority. Lapouge, confronted with this fact, tried to offset its  significance by the statement that   I have never said or thought that the superiority of the homo - Europaeus is due to their mere d olichocephaly, but it is possible  to claim that there is a general correlation between  dolichocephaly and the greatest amount of impulsive activity.  Within any specific race, its more dolichocephalic elements are  dominant. In Mexico, in Java, and among the  negroes, the  dolichocephalic elements occupy the higher social strata, while  the brachycephalic elements compose the bulk of the population  of the lower social classes. All dominant races are  dolichocephalic. ^^   This latter statement is somewhat self -contradictory, but, ignor -  In the terminology and classification of Professor Dixon, this  type is near the Dixon Caspian type.

Y., 1923, passim,  and especially the chapter, "General conclusions."   ^ TOPINARD, Anthropology, pp. 240 -242.  Lapouge, L'Aryen, p. 395.

## Summary

This text discusses the relationship between head shape and social class. It argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that the dominant classes within each race are composed principally of dolichocephals.

## Context

The text is part of a larger debate about the relationship between race and intelligence. Some scholars have argued that there is a link between head shape and intelligence, and that this link explains why certain races are more successful than others. This text challenges this claim, arguing that there is no evidence to support it.

## Key Concepts and Figures

The key concepts in this text are head shape, social class, and race. The main figure is Franz Boas, a German-American anthropologist who argued against the claim that there is a link between head shape and intelligence.

## Contributions and Implications

Boas' work has had a significant impact on the study of race and intelligence. His research showed that there is no evidence to support the claim that certain races are more intelligent than others. This has helped to debunk the myth of racial superiority and has contributed to a more inclusive understanding of human diversity.

## Significance and Impact

The debate about the relationship between race and intelligence is a complex one with no easy answers. However, Boas' work has helped to show that there is no scientific basis for the claim that certain races are more intelligent than others. This is an important finding that has helped to debunk the myth of racial superiority and has contributed to a more inclusive understanding of human diversity.

## Metaphor

The relationship between head shape and social class can be compared to the relationship between height and social class. Just as there is no evidence to support the claim that tall people are more likely to be successful than short people, there is no evidence to support the claim that dolichocephals are more likely to be successful than brachycephals. In both cases, the evidence suggests that social class is determined by a complex set of factors, including education, family background, and personal ambition.## The data concerning the past are very scarce and uncertain

The data concerning the past are very scarce and uncertain. This is because the past is gone and we can't go back and observe it directly. We can only rely on indirect evidence, such as written records, artifacts, and fossils. This evidence is often incomplete, biased, and open to interpretation. As a result, it can be difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the past.

## Several prominent kings of the past, e.g., Tiberius, and some other Roman emperors were rather broadheaded

Several prominent kings of the past, e.g., Tiberius, and some other Roman emperors were rather broadheaded. This is evident from their portraits and sculptures. This suggests that there may have been a genetic predisposition for broadheadedness in some royal families.

## Conclusion

The data concerning the past are very scarce and uncertain. However, the evidence suggests that there may have been a genetic predisposition for broadheadedness in some royal families. This is just one example of the challenges of studying the past.**The Hypothesis of the Longheaded Aristocracy**

The hypothesis that the aristocracy of ancient times was longheaded is based on very scarce and uncertain evidence. There are both dolichocephalic (longheaded) and brachycephalic (broadheaded) people in both well-to-do and poor groups. The most gifted children of America are not dolichocephalic in their total. The cranial index of the higher social groups of the English population is by no means more dolichocephalic than that of the criminals or the general population. There is no correlation between social class and head shape.

**Conclusion**

The hypothesis of the longheaded aristocracy is not supported by the evidence.***FAILED TO SUMMARISE***

The theories in regard to pigmentation are no better supported.  We have seen that, according to Lapouge, the second  characteristic of the Aryan or Nordic race is its blondness. Like  doHcho -cephaly, it is supposed to be correlated with energy,  talent, and o ther superior mental qualities. Accordingly, the  partizans of the Aryan or the Nordic race contend that the upper  classes of the Western societies and their leaders are more blond  than the lower classes and common people. In a recent paper H.  Onslow and B.  S. Bramwell repeat that "the ruling class has  always been fair complexioned"; that the word ''fair" means ''bright  and blond"; and that blondness is a characteristic of mental and  social superiority.^^ To what extent is this contention true? So far  as the  collected data show, it is entirely baseless. Let us consider  the pigmentation of the upper and lower social classes, putting  aside the guesses about the color of past aristocracy, or the quite  incidental references to the pigmentation of the few historic al  prominent men (which may be confronted by no less numerous  opposite examples) and let us take to factual evidence. The study  of Niceforo gives the results in this respect in the table on page  274.^^ The data contradict completely the criticized theory. The  poor children have a higher per cent of fairness than have the  wealthy.

**Summary**

The text is about a study on British men of genius. It shows that the royal family is not as blond as commonly believed, and that men of genius are not all blond.

**Context**

The study was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Edinburgh. The researchers collected data on the hair color of British men of genius from a variety of sources, including historical records and portraits.

**Key concepts and figures**

The researchers found that the royal family is not as blond as commonly believed. In fact, only one of the last 10 British monarchs has been blond. The researchers also found that men of genius are not all blond. In fact, only about one-third of the men in the study were blond.

**Contributions and implications**

The study's findings challenge the common belief that blond hair is a sign of intelligence or genius. The researchers suggest that other factors, such as education and social class, are more important in determining a person's level of intelligence.

**Significance and impact**

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of intelligence and genius. They suggest that we should not rely on stereotypes when judging a person's intelligence.

**Metaphor**

The study's findings can be compared to the story of the emperor's new clothes. In the story, the emperor is tricked into believing that he is wearing a beautiful new suit of clothes when he is actually naked. The study's findings show that we are all susceptible to believing in stereotypes, even when they are not true.

CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGICAL IHEORIES   at the top of the list; second, that the pigmentation of the  hereditary aristocracy is dark, and much darker, than that of the  created peers who came out from the middle classes; third, that  the statesmen and explorers —the men of energy —were dark.  These fa cts refute completely the one -sided interpretation of this  table which was given by H. Onslow. The figures do not give any  confirmation of the ''blond theory" and its variations. The above is  enough to show that this theory, in spite of its popularity, has  no  scientific basis.^^^   Besides these anthropometric data, historical evidence seems to  testify against the criticized theory, for the Nordic races of Europe  were the latest to develop civilization.   Civilization was more precocious in the South of the Eur opean  continent than in the North, and, of all the people of Europe, it  was the population of North Europe and of the Baltic sea coast  which remained the most retarded in regard to intellectual culture.  Therefore it is absurd to pretend that the Nordics we re  responsible for the creation and promotion of culture in the  remotest past. On the contrary, their invasions ever3rwhere  caused either stagnation or regress of development.   The cultivation of plants, the domestication of animals, and the  use of bronze a nd metals were all developed long ago, since the  neolithic epoch. The same is true in regard to many other  fundamental inventions and discoveries in technique and religion,  in mores, and in social institutions.^^^ For these reasons, it is  impossible to pre tend that the blond, tall and dolichocephalic  Aryans have alone been the conquerors, the aristocracy, and the  bearers of mental superiority and progress.   On the other hand, Lapouge seems to underestimate the role and  the achievements of the brachycephalic Alpine racial type. Nearer  to the truth seems to be Dixon's statement that, 'Tf in the history  of the race as a whole, the Mediterranean and Caspian  (Lapouge's Nordic race) peoples have played a great part, that of  the Alpines seems hardly less impressive;  and there is not a little  reason to believe that only where these types have met and  mingled have the highest achievements been attained."

ANTHROPO -RACIAL, SELECTIONIST, HEREDITARIST m   ing to the author just such a blending took place when the  Babylonian civilization rose to its climax; and when the Greek and  the Roman, the Chinese and the Italian attained great  achievements. Though these statements are rather guesses,  nevertheless they appear to be nearer to the facts than Lapouge's  one-sided theory. *To no one race or type (among the Nordic,  Mediterranean and the Alpine races) can the palm be assigned,  but rather i: o the product of the blending of those types which  seem the most gifted, —the Mediterranean, Caspian and the  Alpine." ^^^   If this fundamental contention of the criticized theory fails, then  many inferences from it, such as the theory of degeneration due  to an increase of the cephalic index; such as the explanation of  the decay of ancient Rome and Greece through the substitution of  the brachycephals for the dolichocephals; such as the negative  appreciation of the brachycephalic aristocracy of the democratic  societies; and such as the alleged superiority of the blonds; all  these popular inferences must fall down also, like a row of  dominoes when the first one has been pushed over.   4. Other Ammon -Laponge Laws. —Let us now briefly touch the  validity of other laws  indicated above.

## Summary

The author refutes several "laws" of anthropologists, selectionists, and hereditarists, arguing that their conclusions are based on partial and local results that are not generalizable.

The author criticizes the "Law of Migration", "Law of Concentration of the Dolichocephals", "Law of Stratification", and "Law of Urban Elimination". The author also questions the validity of the "law of a more rapid destruction of the more perfect species".

The author argues that the school is right in emphasizing the innate differences between races, social classes, and individuals. However, the author also argues that these differences are not as great as the school claims and that they are not the only factors that determine an individual's success or failure.

## Key Concepts and Figures

* **Anthropologists:** Scientists who study human beings and their cultures.
* **Selectionists:** Scientists who believe that evolution is driven by natural selection.
* **Hereditarians:** Scientists who believe that heredity is the primary factor in determining an individual's characteristics.
* **Law of Migration:** The theory that humans migrate from areas with less favorable conditions to areas with more favorable conditions.
* **Law of Concentration of the Dolichocephals:** The theory that dolichocephalic (long-headed) people are more likely to be found in urban areas than in rural areas.
* **Law of Stratification:** The theory that people are divided into social classes based on their heredity.
* **Law of Urban Elimination:** The theory that the most intelligent people are more likely to live in urban areas than in rural areas.
* **Law of a more rapid destruction of the more perfect species:** The theory that the most perfect species are more likely to become extinct than less perfect species.

## Contributions and Implications

The author's criticisms of the "laws" of anthropologists, selectionists, and hereditarists have had a significant impact on the field of sociology. The author's work has helped to show that these "laws" are not as universal as they were once thought to be and that there are a number of factors other than heredity that contribute to an individual's success or failure.

## Significance and Impact

The author's work has helped to shape the modern understanding of human evolution and heredity. The author's criticisms of the "laws" of anthropologists, selectionists, and hereditarists have helped to show that these "laws" are not as universal as they were once thought to be and that there are a number of factors other than heredity that contribute to an individual's success or failure.

## Metaphor

The author's criticisms of the "laws" of anthropologists, selectionists, and hereditarists can be compared to a person who is trying to build a house without a blueprint. The person may be able to build a house, but it will not be as strong or as well-designed as a house that was built according to a blueprint. Similarly, the "laws" of anthropologists, selectionists, and hereditarists are based on incomplete data and assumptions, and therefore they cannot be used to build a complete understanding of human evolution and heredity.## The Relationship Between Social Class and Intelligence

This article studies the relationship between social class and intelligence. It finds that the upper classes produce more geniuses than the lower classes.

### Exploration of Genius Across Social Strata

Research reveals that higher societal ranks (including nobility, professionals, and affluent manufacturers and merchants) have a greater prevalence of genius individuals than lower labor classes.

### The Evolution of U.S. Population

Between the years 1818 and 1860, the population of the United States expanded from 5.5 million to 31.4 million.

### Socioeconomic Status of Influential Americans

Investigation into the socioeconomic backgrounds of prominent figures listed in Who's Who indicates that the majority hail from the upper and middle classes, with a negligible percentage emerging from the labor class.

### Investigating the Link Between Social Class and Intelligence

This article examines the connection between social class and intelligence. The findings suggest that higher social classes tend to have higher intelligence levels than lower ones. Children from professional and affluent families possess higher IQs compared to those from labor classes.

### Conclusion

Evidence indicates a correlation between social class and intelligence. Children from higher social classes are more likely to demonstrate higher intelligence than those from lower social classes. This could be attributed to various factors, including superior nutrition, education, and opportunities.
Further corroborating evidence is found in similar studies conducted in the US, Germany, England, and France, highlighting a global correlation between social standing and intelligence.

***Interpreting the Findings***
Intellectual capability, as gauged by mental tests across different social strata, yields results consistent with the above. While explanations for these results vary, even those attributing these disparities mainly to environmental factors don't completely negate the role of heredity and selection. A comprehensive examination of the data suggests that both environment and heredity play a part in these differences. This suggests that the commonly held view of different classes possessing distinct characters carries some truth. However, it would be a mistake to ignore the significant role that environment plays in these differences.

# Racial Variations: Physical and Mental Attributes

The existence of physical and mental variations among diverse racial groups is largely acknowledged. The areas of contention are not the recognition of these variations, but their interpretation as the basis for racial categorization and its historical context. Regardless of how these groups are classified, the presence of distinctive zoological racial types is indisputable.

There is considerable evidence supporting the existence of mental variations among racial groups, whether these are attributed to environmental factors or heredity. Significant mental discrepancies are observed among primary racial (not national) groups. This is evident from the varying roles different races have played in human history and their respective cultural achievements. Every group has had sufficient opportunity and time to establish intricate civilizations, but the contributions of Proto-Australoid and Proto-Negroid races seem to be limited compared to those of the Caspian, Alpine, and Mediterranean races.

These variations in cultural contributions and historical roles are further reinforced by experimental studies on racial mentality and psychology. As research methods improve, the mental differences among races become more evident. Our understanding has shifted from mere speculation to empirical study in this field, revealing intriguing findings. The historical roles of Proto-Negroids and Proto-Australoids have been moderate, corroborated by mental test results. It is established that the intelligence quotient (IQ) of these races is generally lower compared to others like the Caspian, Mediterranean, Alpine, and their mixes with the yellow race.

This paper presents evidence suggesting that the intelligence level of individuals identified as black is lower than that of individuals identified as white or Asian.

Detailed study results by various investigators, such as Ferguson, Trabuci, Yerkes, Pintner, Keller, Thorndike, Mitchell, Rosanoff, Hirsh, Peterson, and others, demonstrate a pattern of lower IQ scores and mental ages for individuals identified as black or Negro, compared to those identified as white. In addition, studies indicate that individuals identified as mulattoes show superior capabilities when they have a higher percentage of white heritage.

The period between 1919-1921 was a time of significant global changes. The aftermath of World War I led to the fall of the Russian Empire and the emergence of the Soviet Union. The Treaty of Versailles imposed severe conditions on Germany. In the United States, the 1920s were marked by the enforcement of Prohibition and the rise of the Jazz Age.

Additional studies by researchers such as McFadden, Dashiell, Brigham, Sunne, Pressey, Arlitt, Derrick, Schwegler, Winn, Murdock, Pyle and others, also present similar findings. They collectively propose that white individuals exhibit stronger personality traits, and that the mental age and IQ of black individuals lag behind that of white individuals. The IQ of black individuals is also suggested to decrease with age.

## Key Studies on Racial Differences

1. **H. H. Goddard, "The Kallikak Family"**
Goddard's examination of the Kallikak family stands as an influential study on intelligence testing. He suggested that intelligence is genetically inherited and children of "feebleminded" parents are prone to be "feebleminded" themselves. Despite criticism on the small sample size, the study greatly influenced the understanding of intelligence as a natural trait and thus had substantial impact on the progression of the eugenics movement in the United States.

2. **C. C Brigham, A Study of American Intelligence**
Brigham's investigation, among the pioneering large-scale intelligence studies in America, demonstrated that white Americans, on average, outperformed black Americans on intelligence tests. Brigham's work gave empirical support to the use of intelligence testing.

**Analogy**
The research conducted by Goddard, Brigham, and Sunne can be likened to a house built on shaky grounds. The foundational belief here is that intelligence is an unchangeable attribute determined by race. This assertion, unsupported by scientific evidence, has unfortunately been exploited to rationalize discrimination and segregation. The metaphorical house built on this base is unstable and at risk of falling apart.

## Consensus Across Different Studies on Racial Intelligence
Several studies examined have demonstrated consistent results despite variations in testing methods. These studies collectively found that the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of black individuals is generally lower than that of their white counterparts. Moreover, research has shown that the infusion of white ancestry into black individuals tends to correlate with a higher IQ. This consensus across historical, cultural, and mental evaluations indicates a potential role for heredity in these disparities.

## Racial Superiority and Mixed-race Individuals 
There is a consistent pattern suggesting the superiority of mixed-race individuals over their full-blood counterparts. This pattern is not confined to the black-white racial dynamic, but extends to other racial groups such as Native Indians. This observation implies that genetic factors may play a more significant role than environmental influences in determining intellectual capabilities.

## Comparative Analysis of Various Ethnic Groups and the Influence of Heredity

Comparisons between distinct ethnic groups like Chinese, Japanese, and upper and lower caste Hindus, highlight a correlation between historical and cultural achievements and scores on mental tests. However, environmental factors alone fail to sufficiently explain the noticed disparities across races. Numerous studies factoring in economic, occupational, and social statuses still observe lower scores for black individuals compared to white individuals on most mental function evaluations. Such consistent patterns underscore the influence of heredity, since environmental factors alone fail to account for these differences.

### Review of Various Studies

Notable studies related to this include:

- Garth, T. R., in his works ["Racial Differences in Mental Fatigue"](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/apl), ["White, Indian, and Negro Work Curves"](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/apl), and ["A Review of Racial Psychology"](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bul) highlighted these disparities.
- Studies like those of Hunter, W. S., and Sommermier, E., "The Relation of Degree of Indian Blood to Score on the Otis Int. Test" also contributed to these findings.

Cultural and historical achievements of different racial types also correspond with their mental test results. For instance, Brahman (high caste) and Panchama (low caste) children from India, who belong to different racial types, score differently. Brahman children score just slightly lower than American white children of the same age, whereas Panchama children score considerably lower than both these groups. Furthermore, Panchama children, much like some African American children in other studies, show no improvement in their performance speed after the age of twelve. 

The evaluation of different European nationalities or stocks, based on their languages (such as Anglo-Saxons, Germans, Swedes, Italians), does not provide a clear cut racial group representation in the zoological sense. Consequently, the results of mental tests of these nationalities could be contradictory, showing differences that are not too large. 

### Conclusion

Based on the above and similar studies, it is safe to say that the mental capacities of various races, especially that of the white and black races (as per the given tests), differ. This doesn't infer superiority or inferiority of one race over another. Instead, the variations simply highlight differing scores. It is possible that in other respects, black individuals may score higher than white individuals. 

However, it is not the task of science to evaluate, but rather to uncover the facts, specifically whether races differ, and if so, what these differences are. Evaluations are a matter of individual subjective taste. The recognition of these differences is crucial but exaggerating these differences is misleading. The discrepancies between upper and lower social classes of the same race may often exceed those between different races. 

Finally, the interpretation of these differences as characteristics of "superiority" and "inferiority" is largely subjective. For example, one could argue that the ability to abstain from the creation of a complex civilization is a trait of "superiority," while the contrary could be considered a sign of "perversion." From this perspective, the black race would be "superior," while the white race would be "inferior." 

In conclusion, from a scientific viewpoint, the acknowledgment of these dissimilarities is all that matters. The evidence suggests that these differences are not solely due to environmental factors but have a significant component of hereditary influence. 
### Assessing Racial Differences

Discussion regarding racial disparities often oscillates between extremes of asserting racial inferiority or claiming absolute racial mental equality. However, this oversimplified narrative overlooks the objective examination of bodily and mental variances across different races. A more accurate assessment can be achieved by setting aside biased evaluations of 'superiority' and 'inferiority'. Recent studies, like those by Porteus and Babcock, along with innovative methods of chemically testing the reaction of blood from different races to specific reagents, further validate this viewpoint.

### Role of Environment and Heredity in Racial Differences

Anthropo-racial, selectionist, and hereditarian perspectives highlight the significant roles of both environmental conditions and heredity in racial differences. It is impossible to attribute these disparities solely to environmental factors, and any serious investigator would concede the role of heredity in these matters. Such a viewpoint is not invalidated by arguments proposed by figures like Gobineau. 

A few observations defy explanation purely based on environmental influences:

1. Within the same environment, some racial groups have managed to develop complex cultures, while others remain in simpler cultural forms.
2. Some races have established complex civilizations in varying geographical contexts, while others have remained stagnant across different geographical conditions.
3. The existence of individuals with exceptional intelligence or severe intellectual disability cannot be entirely attributed to environmental factors.
4. People from similar environments have achieved different things.
5. Both highly successful individuals and underachievers emerge from the most favorable environments.
6. The rise of the proletariat in the 19th and 20th centuries did not correspond with an increase in the number of 'genius' individuals, despite an increase in educational opportunities.

These observations can be better explained by taking into account the factor of heredity, primarily through the gene combination of parents. This perspective doesn't undermine the role of direct environmental influences such as diet, climate, occupation, education, etc. But to witness significant changes in hereditary racial qualities, prolonged periods of time are necessary. 

Morselli argues that the physical and mental traits distinguishing various human races are not permanent but require hundreds or thousands of years for substantial transformations to occur.

### The School of Race and Social Decay

The School of Race and Social Decay proposes that shifts in a population's racial composition can contribute to the decline of social structures and processes. This is exemplified by Rome's decay, attributed partially to the loss of its 'best' people through wars and revolutions. It is hypothesized that the modern trend of differential fertility rates and declining birth rates in Western societies may similarly affect their future social life.

**Key Concepts and Figures**

The key concepts in the school of race and social decay are race, heredity, selection, and social decay. The main figures associated with this school of thought are Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Madison Grant, and Lothrop Stoddard.

**Contributions and Implications**

The school of race and social decay has made a number of contributions to the study of social decay. These include:

* The emphasis on the importance of heredity and selection in understanding social decay.
* The recognition that changes in the racial composition of a population can lead to a decline in social organization and processes.
* The suggestion that the contemporary form of differential fertility and low birth rate in Western societies will exert some negative influences on their social life in the future.

The implications of the school of race and social decay are significant. If the claims of this school are true, then it means that social decay is inevitable and that there is nothing that can be done to prevent it. This is a pessimistic view of human nature and society.

**Comparison with Other Schools of Thought**

The school of race and social decay is in contrast to the school of social evolution, which argues that societies progress through a series of stages from simple to complex. The school of race and social decay also contrasts with the school of social ecology, which argues that the environment is the primary factor in determining the development of a society.

**Conclusion**

The school of race and social decay is a pessimistic school of thought that argues that social decay is inevitable. This school of thought has made a number of contributions to the study of social decay, but its claims are controversial and there is no consensus on their validity.**Social Darwinism**

Social Darwinism is a school of thought that argues that the principles of natural selection, as found in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, can be applied to human societies. Social Darwinists believe that the fittest individuals and groups will rise to the top, while the weakest will be eliminated. This theory has been used to justify a wide range of social policies, from eugenics to laissez-faire capitalism.

**Key Concepts**

* **Natural selection:** The process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.
* **Survival of the fittest:** The idea that the organisms that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.
* **Eugenics:** The practice of improving the genetic quality of a population by selective breeding.
* **Laissez-faire capitalism:** The economic system in which the government does not interfere in the free market.

**Key Figures**

* Charles Darwin: English naturalist who developed the theory of evolution by natural selection.
* Herbert Spencer: English philosopher who popularized the term "survival of the fittest."
* Francis Galton: English scientist who founded the field of eugenics.
* William Graham Sumner: American sociologist who advocated laissez-faire capitalism.

**Impacts and Consequences**

Social Darwinism has left an indelible mark on Western thought and culture. Its principles have been invoked to support a myriad of social policies, ranging from eugenics to laissez-faire capitalism. Nevertheless, its practices have drawn criticism due to their inherent racism, classism, and sexism.

**Importance**

The school of thought, Social Darwinism, carries a significant weight of controversy and complexity. Despite deeply influencing Western thought and culture, it faces strong condemnation for perpetuating racism, classism, and sexism.

**Analogy**

Drawing a parallel, Social Darwinism can be likened to a natural catastrophe. Just as natural disasters devastate communities, Social Darwinism, too, can fracture societies. Both scenarios are a testament to the survival of the fittest, where stronger individuals or groups survive, leaving the vulnerable ones to potentially perish.

**Author's Conclusion**

The author concludes by expressing that the theories propounded by the anthropo-racial, selectionist, and hereditarist schools lean towards a one-sided view and require refinement. Similarly, the theories concerning race blending by Gobineau, Lapouge, and numerous eugenists are considered partial, leaving the issue unresolved. However, the author acknowledges that this school of thought has played a crucial role in shaping sociology. Disregarding its hyperboles and fallacies, it's impossible to overlook its significant contributions to our understanding.
