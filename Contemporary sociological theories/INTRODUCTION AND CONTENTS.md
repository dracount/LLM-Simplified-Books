## Summary

This is a book on contemporary sociological theories, produced in DAISY format by the Internet Archive. Sorokin's book is a sound antidote to two contrasting types of error in sociological theory: either accepting speculative explanations of social phenomena with credulity, or dismissing all theorizing as unscientific.

## Context

Sorokin was a Russian-American sociologist who lived from 1889 to 1968. He was a prolific writer and produced over 40 books and 500 articles. His work was wide-ranging, but he is best known for his contributions to the sociology of knowledge and social change.

## Key Concepts and Figures

The key concepts in Sorokin's work include social morphology, social dynamics, and social stratification. Social morphology is the study of the structure of society, while social dynamics is the study of how societies change over time. Social stratification is the study of how people are ranked in a society.

Sorokin's work was influenced by a number of thinkers, including Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Ã‰mile Durkheim. He also drew on his own experiences as a Russian immigrant to the United States.

## Contributions and Implications

Sorokin's work made a number of important contributions to sociology. He developed new ways of studying social structure and social change, and he challenged the prevailing view that all societies are inevitably moving towards progress. His work also had a significant impact on the development of the sociology of knowledge and social stratification.

## Significance and Impact

Sorokin's work is still relevant today, as it provides a valuable perspective on the challenges facing modern societies. His work is also a reminder that sociology is not just about studying the past, but also about understanding the present and the future.

## Metaphor

Sorokin's work can be compared to a map of a new territory. It provides a way of understanding the complex social world, and it can help us to navigate the challenges that we face.

This chapter discusses the relationship between geographical environment and social phenomena. It begins by examining the concept of geographical environment, which is defined as the physical and biological conditions of a region that influence human activity. The chapter then discusses the ways in which geographical environment can affect social phenomena, such as business cycles, race, health, climate, human energy and efficiency, mental efficiency, suicide, insanity, crime, birth, death and marriage rates, religion, art and literature, social and political organization of society, genius and the evolution of civilizations.

The chapter concludes by arguing that geographical environment is an important factor in understanding social phenomena, but it is not the only factor. Other factors, such as culture, history, and economics, also play a role in shaping human behavior.

**Key Concepts and Figures**

* Geographical environment: The physical and biological conditions of a region that influence human activity.
* Business cycles: The periodic fluctuations in economic activity that occur over time.
* Race: A group of people who share common physical characteristics.
* Health: The physical and mental well-being of an individual or group.
* Climate: The average weather conditions in a region over a long period of time.
* Human energy and efficiency: The amount of physical and mental work that a person can do in a given amount of time.
* Mental efficiency: The ability to think clearly and rationally.
* Suicide: The act of intentionally taking one's own life.
* Insanity: A mental disorder that impairs a person's ability to think clearly and rationally.
* Crime: An act that is considered to be illegal.
* Birth, death and marriage rates: The number of births, deaths, and marriages that occur in a given population over a period of time.
* Religion: A system of beliefs and practices concerning the supernatural.
* Art and literature: The creative expression of human thought and feeling.
* Social and political organization of society: The way in which a society is structured and governed.
* Genius: Exceptional intellectual or creative ability.
* Evolution of civilizations: The process by which human societies have developed over time.

**Contributions and Implications**

The chapter makes several important contributions to the understanding of the relationship between geographical environment and social phenomena. First, it provides a comprehensive overview of the different ways in which geographical environment can affect human activity. Second, it argues that geographical environment is an important factor in understanding social phenomena, but it is not the only factor. Third, it provides a framework for understanding how geographical environment interacts with other factors, such as culture, history, and economics, to shape human behavior.

The implications of the chapter's findings are significant. First, they suggest that the environment in which we live can have a profound impact on our health, our mental well-being, and our ability to achieve success in life. Second, they suggest that we need to be aware of the ways in which our environment can affect our behavior, and we need to take steps to mitigate any negative effects. Third, they suggest that we need to work together to create a more sustainable environment for ourselves and for future generations.

**Significance and Impact**

The chapter's findings have had a significant impact on the way in which we understand the relationship between geographical environment and social phenomena. They have helped to shape our understanding of the factors that contribute to business cycles, race, health, climate, human energy and efficiency, mental efficiency, suicide, insanity, crime, birth, death and marriage rates, religion, art and literature, social and political organization of society, genius and the evolution of civilizations.

The chapter's findings have also been used to develop policies and programs that aim to improve the environment and to mitigate the negative effects of environmental degradation on human health and well-being.

**Metaphor**

The relationship between geographical environment and social phenomena can be likened to the relationship between a seed and a tree. The seed represents the geographical environment, and the tree represents the social phenomena. The**Sociology** is the study of society and social interaction. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on a variety of disciplines, including  history, psychology, economics, and anthropology.

**Biological sociology** is a branch of sociology that focuses on the  relationship between biological factors and social behavior. This field  examines how biological factors, such as genetics, hormones, and  brain structure, influence social behavior.

**Demographic sociology** is a branch of sociology that focuses on  the study of population. This field examines how population size,  density, and growth rates affect social behavior.

**Sociologistic sociology** is a branch of sociology that focuses on  the study of social institutions. This field examines how social  institutions, such as the family, the economy, and the government,  influence social behavior.

**Economic sociology** is a branch of sociology that focuses on the  study of the relationship between economic factors and social  behavior. This field examines how economic factors, such as income,  wealth, and poverty, influence social behavior.

**Sociology** is a complex and multifaceted field that is constantly  evolving. As new research is conducted, our understanding of the  relationship between social and biological factors continues to grow.

**Sociology** is a powerful tool that can be used to understand  and improve society. By understanding the factors that influence  social behavior, we can develop policies and programs that can  create a more just and equitable society.

**Sociology** is like a map of society. It helps us to understand  the complex relationships between different social factors and  how they influence our lives. With this knowledge, we can make  informed decisions about how to create a better world.## The Psychological School in Sociology

The psychological school in sociology is a school of thought that emphasizes the importance of psychology in understanding social behavior. This school of thought argues that human behavior is not simply the result of external factors, such as social structure or culture, but is also influenced by internal factors, such as personality and motivation.

The psychological school in sociology has its roots in the work of early sociologists such as Ã‰mile Durkheim and Max Weber. Durkheim argued that social facts, such as norms and values, are external to individuals and exert a powerful influence on their behavior. Weber, on the other hand, argued that individuals' actions are motivated by their subjective understanding of the world.

The psychological school in sociology has been further developed by a number of sociologists, including George Herbert Mead, Charles Horton Cooley, and Talcott Parsons. Mead argued that the self is a social product, and that individuals' interactions with others shape their sense of self. Cooley argued that individuals' self-concepts are shaped by the way they believe others perceive them. Parsons argued that social systems are made up of interrelated parts, and that each part plays a specific role in maintaining the system.

The psychological school in sociology has been criticized for being too individualistic. Critics argue that the school ignores the importance of social structure and culture in shaping human behavior. However, the psychological school has also made a number of important contributions to sociology, including its emphasis on the importance of subjective meaning and its insights into the relationship between individuals and society.

## Conclusion

Sociology is like a tree. The trunk of the tree is social structure, and the branches are the different schools of sociological thought. The psychological school in sociology is one of the branches of the tree. It emphasizes the importance of psychology in understanding social behavior. The psychological school is not the only branch of the tree, but it is an important one. Without the psychological school, we would not have a complete understanding of sociology.
