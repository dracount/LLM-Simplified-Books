## II. Classification of the Schools of Contemporary Sociology

This section presents a classification of different schools within contemporary sociology. Each school represents a distinct approach to studying and understanding society.

### A. Mechanistic School

The Mechanistic School focuses on understanding society through the lens of social mechanics, social physics, social energetics, and mathematical sociology as developed by Pareto. These approaches view society as a system governed by specific laws and principles.

### D. Biological School

The Biological School explores the connection between biology and society. It is divided into two branches: the bio-organismic branch, which examines the role of biology in shaping social behavior, and the racialist, hereditarist, and selectionist branch, which investigates the influence of genetics and natural selection on social characteristics.

### E. Bio-Social School

The Bio-Social School, particularly demographic sociology, explores the intersection of biology and social factors, with a specific focus on demographic trends and their impact on society.

### F. Bio-Psychological School

The Bio-Psychological School, specifically the instinctivists' sociology, examines how biological instincts shape social behavior and interactions.

### G. Sociologistic School
