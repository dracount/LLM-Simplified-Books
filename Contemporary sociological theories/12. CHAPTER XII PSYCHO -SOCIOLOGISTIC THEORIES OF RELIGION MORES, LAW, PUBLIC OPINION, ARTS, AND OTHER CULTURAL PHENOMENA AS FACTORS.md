#Chapter XII Psycho-sociologistic Theories of Religion: Mores, Law, Public Opinion, Arts, and Other Cultural Phenomena as Factors.
##Understanding Psycho-Sociologistic Theories of Religion
This article seeks to provide an easy-to-understand overview of psycho-sociologistic theories of religion. These theories look at social patterns and behaviors through the lens of cultural influences like religion, law, and arts. They are classified as 'psycho-sociologistic' because they incorporate both psychological and sociological perspectives.

###Exploring the Sea of Theories
The number of these theories is immense, and to cover them all in one go would be an impossible task. Instead, this article will focus on a select group of these theories, particularly those that examine the societal role of beliefs and religion.

###Digging Deeper into Beliefs and Religion
We'll delve into some of the main theories in this area, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses, and common pitfalls. These theories often share similar limitations, so a thorough understanding of this group will give us insights into the others as well.

###Broadening the Perspective
After understanding the essence of religious and belief-oriented theories, we can give a nod to other related theories. A few examples and comments will shed light on their validity and potential issues.

This approach to dissecting and understanding the numerous psycho-sociologistic theories of cultural influences is the most feasible and effective way under the given circumstances.

###Analyzing the Psychological Aspects
These theories also incorporate psychological viewpoints, so their analysis will reinforce the ideas presented in the previous discussions about the psychological school. Next, we will take a look at how social phenomena are interpreted in the context of beliefs and religion.

# Understanding Psycho-Sociological Theories of Religion

## Introduction

This article aims to explore major theories that examine the role of beliefs and religion in the dynamics of societal phenomena. In this context, "beliefs" refer to judgments that are either beyond scientific competence, scientifically inaccurate, or unproven scientifically. All non-scientific judgments fall under the category of beliefs, which constitute a significant part of everyone's mental understanding. These beliefs often take on a pseudoscientific character, making them hard to detect.

## Questions to Answer

The main questions this article seeks to answer include: What are the societal functions of such beliefs? Do they influence societal phenomena? If they do, what is their role, and what relationships exist between these beliefs and other aspects of social life? The answers to these questions can be found in various studies and research pieces, some of which will be discussed in this article.

## Limitations

However, it's important to note that theological theories stating that the history of the universe and humanity is controlled by divine or mystical powers fall outside the scope of this article. This is because these theories lie beyond the competence of science and cannot be proven or disproven.

## Review of Related Literature

The literature related to the study of the above-mentioned problems is extensive, and it would be impossible for one person to summarize it all. Nevertheless, there are a few representative works that encompass the main types of these studies.

## Early Theories and Beliefs

The belief that religion or magic is a powerful influence on human fate is potentially the oldest form of social theory. This concept is prevalent in ancient sources of human thought and the holy scriptures of various religions. Furthermore, many influential thinkers from St. Augustine to H. Spencer have acknowledged the role of beliefs in human life to some extent.

## Notable Theories

Amongst those who have studied the influence of beliefs, magic, and religion, a few stand out. These include theories put forth by F. de Coulanges, B. Kidd, G. Le Bon, Charles Ellwood, E. A. Ross, G. Sorel, E. Durkheim, J. Frazer, and Max Weber.

## F. de Coulanges' Theory (1830 -1889)

F. de Coulanges was a prominent French historian who focused on ancient and medieval history. He presented his sociological theory of religion in his seminal book, 'The Ancient City.' This book represents an attempt to understand the principles and methods that underpin the workings of beliefs.

## Recognition of Religion's Role by Anti-Religious Thinkers

Interestingly, even anti-religious thinkers acknowledge religion's role, at least in the sense of it being necessary for the maintenance of civilization. Machiavelli, for instance, said, "Religion is always necessary for the maintenance of civilization... The sagacious politician will always respect religion even if he has no belief in it... because through inculcating it even by craft, much valour has been roused for the defense of the country."

# The Social Functions of Religion: Various Theories

## Religion as a Social Control Tool

Marsiho of Padua describes religion as a form of police force that can unearth hidden crimes and keep society in line. Similarly, Charles A. Ellwood asserts that religion serves as a vital tool in maintaining social control. These theories highlight religion's key role in shaping and preserving society.

## Religion as a Foundation of Society

Fustel de Coulanges emphasizes that religious ideas often act as catalysts for social changes. He illustrates his point with the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, where religious beliefs directly influenced the structure of social and political institutions. According to Coulanges, religion forms the bedrock of societal formation.

## Durkheim's Theory on Religion

Durkheim's theory on religion emphasizes its social roots and its role in boosting solidarity among community members. He posits that many significant social institutions have their roots in religion. Moreover, he asserts that religion's enduring nature stems from society's inherent need for reaffirming its unity and collective values.

## Le Bon's Theory on the Power of Beliefs

Le Bon argues that people are inherently emotional rather than logical. He suggests that humans often hold illogical beliefs that align with their feelings. These beliefs, according to Le Bon, are potent forces that shape life and history. They form an essential part of the human mind and cannot be eliminated. Any change in these beliefs can cause significant shifts in social life.

## Frazer's Theory on the Role of Superstitions and Beliefs

Frazer offers a more concrete view on the impact of superstitions and beliefs on society. He proposes that these elements effectively guide human behavior and control society. Additionally, Frazer contends that superstitions have played a beneficial role overall. He provides evidence showing how superstition has fortified respect for governance, property rights, and sexual morality in various societies.

In summary, these theories collectively underscore the profound influence of religion, beliefs, and superstitions in shaping societal structures and behaviors.

# Simplified Article on Psycho-Sociological Theories of Religion

## The Effect of Superstition on Human Life

Superstitions, in some societies, have played a role in increasing respect for human life. This has led to a safer life experience. The beliefs and practices, although not always logical, shape the way people behave and relate with each other in these societies.

## G. C. Bougie's Theory on Caste System in India

G. C. Bougie argued that religion plays a crucial role in understanding the creation and persistence of the Indian caste system. Theories based on economy, family ties or races cannot fully explain the origins of the caste system. Religion played a critical role, converting family rituals into sacred practices and promoting separation of racial groups.

Religion led to the establishment of the first law in the form of a religious ruling. It discouraged any racial mixing and regarded it as a grave sin. The caste system became more complicated over time, necessitating specialized education for performing rituals. This situation increased the power of the Brahman caste, leading to their isolation from other groups. Over time, this separation became rigid, hereditary, and permanent under the influence of Brahman priests.

## Religion and Society: Views of E. A. Ross and G. Sorel

E. A. Ross and G. Sorel underlined the influence of beliefs, legends, and myths on human psychology and social processes. Ross stated that cultural elements like beliefs, religion, laws, arts, and science shape human behavior and social interactions. He highlighted that illusions can control human conduct, and beliefs can motivate human actions, regardless of their correctness.

Sorel believed in the power of envisioning the future, even if the vision is objectively incorrect. Myths and legends can powerfully influence this process. The anticipation of the future, particularly when it aligns with the strongest desires of a group, can motivate individuals and shape their passions and thoughts.

For instance, early Christians believed in the imminent return of Christ and the collapse of the pagan world. This vision did not materialize, but it significantly influenced Christian thought.

# Ross: The American Sociology Pioneer

Ross was instrumental in laying the foundations of American sociology. As an acclaimed author, his notable works encompass "Foundations of Sociology," "Social Control," "Social Psychology," and "Principles of Sociology." Often referred to as the "American Tarde," he contributed significantly to the field.

# Understanding Religion Through Psychosociological Theories

Religious beliefs and myths have often shaped the course of history. Prominent religious figures such as Christ, Luther, and Calvin dreamed of a spiritually elevated Europe, but reality fell short of their expectations. Nonetheless, their ideals were pivotal in sparking change. Similarly, Mazzini's dream of a unified Italy, considered unrealistic at his time, proved critical in Italy's transformation into a formidable power.

# Benjamin Kidd's Theory on the Role of Religion and Belief

Benjamin Kidd (1858-1916) offered a comprehensive theory on the social functions of religion and belief. According to Kidd, the struggle for existence was the key driver of evolution. Superior organisms outlasted their inferior counterparts through this struggle. Humanity, too, evolved in this manner, with intellect being a key factor that gave humans an edge over other species.

But this process was not without its costs. Many lives were lost for the progress of a few. The theory suggests that if this struggle for existence were the sole force behind human progress, it would lead to a situation where the most intellectual and selfish groups would outlast the less intellectual ones, leading to relentless strife.

# The Role of Religion in Human Progress

However, this isn't the case. The author posits that religion plays a critical role in human progress. Religion offers what Kidd terms as 'ultra-rational sanction,' encouraging actions that serve society's best interests, even if they don't benefit individuals. This belief system thus helps prevent a pitiless struggle among humans and establishes a check against absolute egotism.

# Understanding the Theories of Religion: A Look at Kidd and Max Weber

## Kidd's Theory on Religion and Society

Kidd proposes that social evolution in humans has not solely been driven by self-interest, but more significantly by a faith that transcends rational understanding, or in simpler words, religion. According to him, religion influences people to act selflessly, encouraging them to make sacrifices for the benefit of their communities and humanity as a whole.

The stronger the religious conviction, the more harmonious the society, increasing its chances of survival. This theory may explain why some societies, despite their intellectual prowess but lack of religious faith, have not survived, while other societies with less intellectual brilliance but stronger religious beliefs, have thrived.

Interestingly, Kidd argues that religion helps humans to accept progress and continue to pay its price without resistance. He claims that intellect is still an important factor for survival, but it's not the primary one.

## Max Weber's Sociology of Religion

Max Weber's extensive work on the sociology of religion is considered one of the most significant contributions in this field. Despite his work being a collection of papers published over many years, and not completed before his death, they provide a comprehensive view of Weber's theories.

Weber's main focus was on the relationship between religion and economic phenomena. His approach was so extensive and well-researched that his work effectively represents a sociology of all culture, and not just religion. One noteworthy aspect of his work is its strong foundation in real-world facts, which adds to its value.

The central question Weber tried to answer was how economic and religious phenomena are related. He questioned whether the economic factors solely influenced religious ones as suggested by some theories, or if religious factors influenced economic ones. Alternatively, he also considered whether both factors were interdependent.

Weber's conclusion was that religious and economic phenomena are mutually dependent. Any theory that only considers one factor as the function of the other is incorrect. This makes both the theory of economic interpretation of history and its opposing theory that economic factors are merely a result of religious ones, flawed in his view.

# Interplay Between Religion and Economics

Economic and religious factors often go hand in hand, and studying one can shed light on how it influences the other. This method has been used by renowned sociologist Max Weber, who has used religious factors to investigate their impact on economics and other social elements.

## Max Weber's Approach

Max Weber's approach can be categorized as 'functionalist', implying that he views religion as a variable that can affect various aspects of society, including economics. In order to understand the influence of religion on economic activities, Weber chooses to study the "economic ethics of a religion". By this, he means not just the theological aspects of a religion but rather the practical behaviors that a religion encourages among its followers.

Weber recognizes that various factors contribute to the economic ethics of a religion, with religion being just one among them. However, he believes that we should consider "economic ethics" primarily as a religious product. He suggests studying the impact of religious ethics on the economic activities of social groups that are both influenced by it and influencing it.

## Studying the Economic Ethics of World Religions

To make his studies feasible, Weber limits his focus to the economic ethics of six world religions, namely: Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. He studies the nature of the economic ethics of each religion and their effects on the economic lives of their followers.

A detailed analysis of each religion's effect is beyond our scope here. However, we can take an example of Weber's study relating to Protestantism and its relationship with modern capitalism to get a sense of his methodology and conclusions.

## Protestantism and Modern Capitalism

Modern capitalism, while having roots in past economic systems, is a relatively new phenomenon with specific characteristics. It's typified by rational organization, scientific management, production for a market and masses, and production for money. It also encourages an ethos of maximum efficiency and dedication to work or vocation.

In this context, Weber's analysis particularly focuses on the relationship between modern capitalism and Protestantism. He has studied the religion's effects on the capitalist ethos, which sees vocational work as a central life goal and a service requiring complete devotion.

# Max Weber and The Protestant Ethic

## The Spirit of Modern Capitalism
According to sociologist Max Weber, modern capitalism is marked by its focus on logic, practicality, and encouragement of creativity and initiative. Weber believed that these qualities were first nurtured by the Protestant religion. Protestant teachings highlighted that one's salvation is achieved through orderly, rational living. 

## Impact of Protestantism
Protestantism endowed a great ethical significance to worldly work, and sanctified hard work, leading to a mindset and behavior that served as the foundation for modern capitalism. Weber believed that this Protestant work ethic, which promotes industriousness and frugality, was a vital prerequisite for the rise of a capitalist economy. 

He also proposed that Protestantism's emphasis on individualism and self-reliance fostered the growth of a market economy. Weber's theory has made a significant contribution to understanding the link between religion and economics. 

## Breaking Traditional Boundaries
Weber observed that the barriers of tradition couldn't be overcome merely by a desire for profit or an increase in population. Instead, he believed that these boundaries could only be broken by the emergence of rational prophets, often backed by miracles or other forms of validation. These figures could dispel the enchantments of tradition, paving the way for modern economic systems, technology, and capitalism. 

## Impact of Different Religions
Weber pointed out that while China lacked such influential prophets, in India, figures like Buddha emerged, advocating liberation from traditions. However, their teachings were focused on spiritual contemplation and had little impact on empirical, everyday life. These teachings could only influence a limited group of intellectuals, leaving the majority of the population in their traditional economic roles.

Contrarily, Judaism and Christianity had a significant impact on the masses and their activities because these religions catered to a broader audience. The middle ages saw the emergence of Protestantism, which expanded the rationalization of life over the masses, thus laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. 

## The Role of Judaism
Weber rejected the theory that modern capitalism was primarily created by Jews. He noted that although Judaism early on broke free from traditionalism and, like Christianity, developed an aversion to magic, the specific circumstances of Jewish people during the middle ages - their isolation from Christians and their status as "pariah-people" - hampered their ability to make significant economic progress. He termed their involvement in economic activities such as money-lending not as modern rational capitalism, but as a degraded "pariah-capitalism".

## The Death of Religious Roots
Weber stated that currently, the religious roots of modern capitalism have diminished. The initial religious enthusiasm and religious worldview have been lost, indicating that a phase in the development of modern capitalism has concluded. As its religious roots have died, it is expected to undergo changes.

## Conclusion
There are certain complexities in the definitions of religion used in these theories, making them challenging to decipher. Despite these issues, Weber's analysis of the relationship between religion and capitalism, especially his emphasis on the Protestant ethic, offers valuable insights into the development of modern economic systems.

# Understanding the Role of Jews in Capitalism and the Impact of Religion on Society

## Jews and Capitalism

Historically, Jewish people were not significantly involved in the world of capitalism until more recent times.

## Defining Religion - A Conundrum

When attempting to study and theorize religion, we encounter numerous issues. The foremost problem is the challenge of defining religion itself. These definitions are often hazy and inconsistent, making the task of building reliable theories difficult.

## Trans-subjective vs Psychic Phenomena

Theories related to religion often interchangeably use trans-subjective and psychic phenomena. The conflation of these two distinct phenomena creates confusion, making it challenging to identify which is the cause and which is the effect in any given context.

## Pinpointing Religion's Impact on Society

Determining how and to what extent religion impacts society is another hurdle. If we manage to establish that religion does influence society, it is still uncertain which aspects of religion are the driving forces behind these influences.

## Case Study - The Trustworthiness Experiment

The complexity of studying religion's effects on society can be illustrated through a study on the potential of fostering trustworthiness in children. For instance, it was observed that Boy Scout training had only a marginal correlation with enhanced trustworthiness. Children who underwent this training demonstrated a slight increase in trustworthiness, while those who did not participate in the training showed a reduction. However, the findings of this study are not as convincing as they might initially seem.

## Critical Analysis of the Trustworthiness Experiment

While the study suggests the effectiveness of training in building trustworthiness, it fails to pinpoint what elements of the training contribute to this outcome. Is the increase in trustworthiness due to the internalization of "ideals," or is it a result of external factors like behavior patterns, reactions and actions of the leaders, peer interaction, repetition of behavior, or even the looming threat of exclusion for dishonest behavior? The study leaves these questions unanswered. 

## The Complexity of Studying Religion's Impact on Society

If such ambiguity exists in a relatively simple scenario like the trustworthiness study, imagine how much more complex it would be to determine religion's influence on large populations and intricate social processes. Here, we have no clear understanding of what we're trying to measure, the phenomena we're attributing to religion, or the benchmarks for measurement.

## Religious Conversion - A Multi-Faceted Process

Take, for example, the process of religious conversion. A study by E.D. Starbuck found a multitude of causes for conversion, including fear of death or hell, self-interest, altruism, moral ideals, remorse, teachings, imitation, example, and social pressure. Each of these causes reflects a mixture of trans-subjective and psychic experiences, underscoring the complex and multi-dimensional nature of religious experiences and their impact on society.

# Simplifying the Complex Theories of Religion's Influence on Society

## Uncertainty in Theories 

The theories that attempt to explain how religion influences society often fail to give clear and definitive answers. Rather, they make broad and unproven assumptions. This lack of certainty is a significant drawback in these theories.

One classic theory from F. de Coulanges suggests that the dynamics of Greek and Roman history were a result of religious beliefs' changes. As these beliefs evolved, they supposedly brought about changes in social and political institutions. However, Coulanges doesn't convincingly prove that changes in religious ideas led to changes in institutions. He also fails to demonstrate if these changes happened simultaneously or if one triggered the other. This absence of clear cause-and-effect relationships highlights the inconsistency in his theory.

In sum, Coulanges' theory suggests that changes in society are related to changes in religion, but it doesn't clarify what causes what. Others like Ed. Meyer and W. G. Sumner argue that religion is more a reflection of social life and societal norms, rather than a source or driver of them.

## Critiquing Contemporary Sociological Theories 

Turning to more contemporary theories, authors such as Durkheim, Ellwood, Le Bon, Sorel, Ross, Frazer, and others argue that religion causes social change. However, they fail to show how or why religion changes over time. They also struggle to explain why certain religious beliefs and myths become influential, while others do not. They treat religious dogmas merely as emotional expressions, ignoring their potential logical or irrational aspects.

## Weber's Wirtschaftsethik 

Max Weber's theory of Wirtschaftsethik, or economic ethics, seems to fare slightly better, but not without its issues. Weber views religion as one of many factors that influence economic ethics. However, he often shifts from this balanced viewpoint to a one-sided cause-and-effect perspective. 

Weber himself admits that religion alone doesn't determine economic ethics. It is influenced by various factors, including geographical, historical, and psychological elements. Thus, the effects attributed to economic ethics can't be credited solely to religion, given that it is shaped by numerous other factors.

In essence, Weber's analysis fails to establish religion as the singular cause of changes in economic life. His theory, while acknowledging multiple influences, still leaves us uncertain about each factor's relative importance.

# Understanding Psycho-Sociological Theories of Religion

## Weber's Analysis of Religion's Role in Economics

Max Weber's theories suggest that the effects of religion play a significant role in shaping economic ethics, but there's uncertainty about the extent of this influence. Despite Weber's insights, it's still unclear how much of an impact religion has on economic ethics and phenomena. Hence, we haven't made much progress in understanding the efficiency of the religious factor in this context, a shortfall similar to earlier theories.

## Problems with Assumptions about Religion's Influence on Civilization

Alongside these central issues, there are other assumptions that are vague or disputable. For example, theorists like Hobhouse and Ellwood argue that when religion declines, so does civilization. They contend that the death of religion would mean the end of all higher civilization. But I find this assertion unclear. 

I haven't found any instances of an absolute decay of religion. Typically, when one religion decays, another ascends. This happened in Rome around the end of the second century B.C. when the traditional religion decayed but was accompanied by the rise of various oriental religions, ultimately Christianity. Similar patterns occurred in Europe at the end of the fourteenth century with the decline of Roman Catholicism and the rise of various sects and Protestantism. 

This pattern indicates that when one religious system is dying, another is emerging. If this is the actual scenario, then statements about the death of all religion appear baseless. If the claim refers to the relative weakening of a religion, it should demonstrate how to measure this. 

## Doubts About Civilization Decay and Religion

For example, since the end of the second century A.D., in Rome's history, there's a notable decline in ancient civilization, especially in the areas of science, literature, and philosophy. According to the theory, this should be accompanied by an increase in irreligion. However, it seems to be paralleled instead by a rise in another type of religious mentality in various forms, particularly among the lower classes. 

This mentality, grounded in religion and antagonistic towards the intellectual achievements of the upper classes, gradually spread to these higher ranks, resulting in the growth of various mystic religions. This culminated in the rise of Christianity. 

Consequently, the decay of the Roman Empire, typically cited as an instance of a civilization's decline due to religious decay, seems to contradict such an assumption. There are numerous instances where societies or civilizations declined amidst a strong religious spirit, such as Tyre, Carthage, and Judea.

## Religion's Social Function and Impact

Other theorists, including B. Kidd and E. Durkheim, suggest that religion's fundamental social function has been the creation and expansion of solidarity. They argue that virtually all altruistic actions by individuals and groups, and the overall process of freeing the masses from slavery and bondage, have been due to religion. However, it's debatable whether these assertions can pass a rigorous scientific test.

Ultimately, while potentially accurate, these theories need a systematic scientific verification to establish their validity. As of now, this evidence is missing in the presentation of these theories. 

# Simplified Review of Psycho-Sociological Theories of Religion

## Surface Impressions and Historical Cases

Psychosocial theories of religion may seem too simplistic. They often focus on the surface of the phenomena, such as religion's role as a tool of unity in some instances, or a cause of conflict and persecution in others. By highlighting one side of the picture while neglecting the other, these theories can become skewed.

Historically, religion has played diverse roles. For example, the caste system in India, which largely marginalized lower castes, existed with religious backing. Similarly, during their expansion, Mohammedanism and Judaism resulted in enslavement of defeated peoples. Christianity, too, has a mixed record. While it has messages condemning slavery, it also contains teachings that instruct servants to obey their masters. Hence, it's tough to determine whether Christianity's influence has been more liberating or oppressive for the masses.

## The Role of Science and Intellect

Another flawed argument often made is that science and intellect are purely selfish, or that irrational beliefs have been increasing over time. I don't subscribe to the view that science is always altruistic or that every scientific advancement leads to societal and altruistic progress. Conversely, the assertion that science and intellect are purely selfish is also incorrect.

The belief that human "irrationality" will quickly disappear while "rationality" will proliferate over time is also not necessarily true. The truth or fallacy of these arguments is yet to be verified.

## Questioning Kidd's Assumptions

Kidd's starting points are questionable. While the concept of the struggle for existence has been a factor in evolution, it's not the only factor. Mutual aid or solidarity has also been influential. It's incorrect to assert that the "progress" of organisms is solely due to the struggle for existence, as Kidd suggests. Mutual aid is as general a phenomenon of life as the struggle for existence. 

Kidd's assumption that all altruistic actions are due to religion, and that without religion there would be none, is flawed. These actions can exist and can be satisfactorily explained without religion. Therefore, Kidd's theory about religion's social role becomes unconvincing.

## Reviewing Weber's Theory

Weber's theory also has its flaws. Weber suggests that only Christianity, and to some extent Judaism, have been hostile to traditionalism, magic, and superstition, and have promoted rationalization of life. According to Weber, this is why modern capitalism developed within the Christian world and why it failed in non-Christian nations. However, this viewpoint is debatable.

Confucianism, for instance, showed a clear disdain for supernaturalism and mysticism. It emphasized a practical character and balanced common sense, which would seemingly align with the development of capitalism. Therefore, Weber's claim about Christianity's unique contribution to the emergence of modern capitalism can be called into question.

# Simplifying the Psycho-Sociologistic Theories of Religion

## Examining Confucianism

Contrary to Weber's statement that Confucianism is more superstitious and hostile to magic than Christianity or Judaism, my view aligns with many other experts who see Confucianism as one of the least superstitious and mystical religions in the world. Confucianism does emphasize "traditionalism," but in a sensible, harmonious way that promotes a healthy conservatism, no more "traditional" than Judaism or Christianity.

Confucianism is a comprehensive system of thought that seeks a practical and balanced way to rationalize social life, completely devoid of mysticism and magic. Thus, Weber's claim is debatable. As a result, his theories on the religious roots of modern capitalism and the causes behind current economic systems in countries with dominant world religions become dubious.

## Critiquing Weber's Typologies

Weber's "typological" characteristics are complex and inconsistent, making his "ideal types" of each world religion and their economic ethics, and even his concepts of "rationalism" and "traditionalism," vague and unsuitable as realistic explanations.

## Facts vs. Theory: The Case of Japan

Looking at Japan, there has been no significant religious change since the second half of the 19th century. Despite remaining predominantly Shinto and Buddhist, Japan has made remarkable progress in rationalizing its economic, social, political, and cultural life. Contrary to Weber's assertion, Japan's "traditionalist and magical" religion didn't prevent the successful development of modern capitalism.

## The Protestant Economic Advantage: A Mere Assertion?

Weber's claim that Protestants are always economically better than adherents of other religions doesn't hold true universally. His statistical data are rather limited, mostly focusing on Baden in Germany, making it impossible to draw global generalizations from such restricted data.

## Conclusion: Need for More Rigorous Research

Weber's theory, in its fundamental and secondary aspects, is far from infallible, as claimed by some of his followers. Existing sociologies of religion are speculative and unsatisfactory, failing to offer a truly scientific analysis of "the role of religion" or a thoroughly verified correlation between well-defined religious and non-religious social phenomena.

While these theories may contain some truth, the extent of this truth remains to be determined. Future researchers should abandon the speculative methods of these theories, clarify the "factor of religion," and engage in careful statistical, historical, and potentially experimental analysis of the related facts to distinguish truth from "rubbish."
# Understanding the Interplay between Societal Factors and Human Behavior

## Introduction

This article delves into the study of relationships between religious and non-religious phenomena. It highlights the importance of societal norms such as folkways, mores, and customs, and how they shape individual and societal behavior. It also discusses Sumner's theory of folkways and mores.

## Sumner's Theory: A Critique

Sumner's theory of folkways and mores is often seen as either tautological or indefinite. It does not provide a clear explanation of how these norms function within social processes. Similarly, the theory of law is imperfect as it fails to elucidate the social role of law.

## The Nature of Law

Law is a unique psychological experience, encompassing an emotion and an idea of certain patterns of action. Its influence on human behavior is seen in three main forms: motivation, shaping, and coercion.

## Importance of Education

The importance of education is another significant aspect discussed in this article.

## Petrazhitsky's Theory of Law as a Psycho-social Factor

Petrazhitsky proposed that law is an energy that drives and regulates human action. It impacts human behavior via motivation, habit formation, and coercion. Law fulfills two social functions: distributive and organizational. While the distributive function allocates rights and duties among individuals, the organizational function establishes authority hierarchies and social institutions. Despite its logical and valid points, Petrazhitsky's theory doesn't clarify why people harbor certain legal convictions.

## Flaws in Current Theories

Current theories, such as the law-factor theory, the theory of mores, and religious theory, don't provide comprehensive explanations as they fail to answer questions like why people obey the law. Similarly, public opinion and propaganda aren't satisfactory explanations due to our limited understanding of their influence on social dynamics.

## Media's Influence on Perception

There is a prevalent belief that the media significantly influences our perception and behavior. However, this article argues that this influence might be exaggerated, with public opinion being more affected by external factors.

## Evaluating the Psychological School of Social Control

The psychological school of social control, despite its various branches and potential advantages, is fraught with issues. Its theories are vague and fail to provide valid correlations. A more meticulous study of these phenomena is required, with a clear distinction between trans-subjective and psychic variables, and precise definitions of studied factors.

## Rethinking the Classification of Social Phenomena

The traditional classification of social phenomena into law, arts, science, religion, and so forth, is argued to be obsolete in modern sociology.

## Psycho-Sociologistic Theories of Religion

The pros and cons of the psycho-sociologistic theories of religion. Although these theories offer valuable insights, they need significant restructuring to overcome their shortcomings. A shift towards pure behavioristic and introspectivist interpretations of social phenomena could lead to clearer and more helpful theories.
